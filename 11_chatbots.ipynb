    "[ELIZA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELIZA) was a chatbot created by Joseph Weizenbaum in the 1960s to mimick a (type of) therapist: someone who asks you further questions about what you are saying. \n",
    "\n",
    "The answers where like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "* <font color=\"green\">Human: Well, my boyfriend made me come here.</font>\n",
    "* <font color=\"purple\">Eliza: Your boyfriend made you come here</font>\n",
    "* <font color=\"green\">Human: He says I'm depressed much of the time.</font>\n",
    "* <font color=\"purple\">Eliza: I am sorry to hear you are depressed</font>\n",
    "* <font color=\"green\">Human: It's true. I am unhappy.</font>\n",
    "* <font color=\"purple\">Eliza: Do you think coming here will help you not to be unhappy</font>\n",
    "* <font color=\"green\">Human: I need some help, tahat much seems certain</font>\n",
    "* <font color=\"purple\">Eliza: What would it mean to you if you got some help</font>\n",

    "\n",
    "You can see that you can create the answers by using pattern-matching, introducing things like \"I am sorry you are X\", when X is in a pre-defined list of negative mental states. \n",
    "\n",
    "This particular implementation is based on [Ahilya's](https://heartbeat.comet.ml/chatbot-development-using-spacy-4f6515cb17b8). It produces an extremely simple dialogue; just a greeting and only in response to \"hello\". You can extend it with other patterns. "
