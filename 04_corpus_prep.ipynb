We use the `re`, regular expression module, to find all the things between angle brackers, and replace them with nothing. Then, print the text again to see if they are gone."

The reasons are many and have been widely discussed: His predecessors left him far more than the allotted limit of political carry-on baggage. His sensible budget of mild spending cuts and slightly higher taxes - but not on corporations - succeeded in galvanizing opposition on both sides of the spectrum. His supposed masterstroke of luring the bulk of the Wildrose official opposition over to the government benches similarly infuriated many Albertans. And after 44 years of PC power, a lot of voters are suddenly ready for change - any change.</p><p>Mr. Prentice has also been hit for calling an early election. What hasn't been talked about is something even more fatal to the Conservatives: a snap election has meant a short election. Very short. And its shortness - less than a month from call to vote - is killing the Progressive Conservatives.</p><p>Four weeks ago, sending voters to the polls early looked like one more work of Prentice genius. But like the Wildrose floor-crossing, it can now be seen as a fatal blunder. And not just because it overrode provincial election law. The quick, short vote left voters with more than enough time to figure out just how angry they are at the PCs - very angry, apparently - but it didn't leave much time to subject the parties receiving the protests votes, Wildrose and the NDP, to anything close to the level of scrutiny visited on the PCs.</p><p>For Mr. Prentice, what was supposed to be a pleasantly brief coronation has instead turned into a painfully short trial.</p><p>Contrast this with what's happening at the federal level. There's a fixed election date, in October. The election cycle is already well under way - with the miles of road between now and then giving the media and the public a chance to scrutinize not just the party in power, but also the alternatives. For example, the more Justin Trudeau and the Liberals rose in the polls over the last year, the more they were increasingly subject to the glare of media coverage and criticism. There's been time to cast a skeptical eye on the thinness of their policy proposals, time for the Conservatives and NDP to respond, and time for the Liberals to respond in turn: on Monday, Justin Trudeau announced his party's intention, if elected, to raise benefits and lower taxes for middle-class Canadians, and pay for it with higher taxes and lower benefits for the wealthiest. And we're still nearly six months from a vote.</p><p>A fixed election date means a long electoral cycle, with time for ebbs and flows. If you're leading in the polls, you're likely to get hit with the bright light of greater public and media scrutiny. There's time to get past first impressions, and for voters to have second, third and fourth thoughts.</p><p>But the dynamics of a short election - just 29 days from start to finish - have been nothing like that. Alberta's election turned into a referendum on the following question: 'This government will surely be re-elected. How unhappy does that make you?' Only in the last few days of the campaign has it become apparent that the PCs may not be returned. It is only just dawning on protest voters that they are not casting protest votes. They're likely electing a new government.</p><p>Normally, that realization would have people pivoting to ask questions about the party on the verge of assuming power: Is the NDP ready to govern? Beyond their likeable leader Rachel Notley, who are they? Do their policies make sense? Do their numbers add up? The same questions could be asked of Wildrose: At this point, the party exists more in name than in fact, yet polls suggest is likely to form the Official Opposition.</p><p>A longer election wouldn't necessarily mean that voters would change their minds. But they'd have motive and opportunity to think about it. Doubts would be raised and they'd have to be answered. But thanks to Mr. Prentice's snap election call, the cycle hasn't had time to turn. And now, just like that, his time's almost certainly up.</p>, <p>'Anyone is crazy who voluntarily goes on The Bachelor,' said Michelle Money (official Bachelor villainess, season 15) after she was eliminated from the show, and millions of people surely nodded in agreement. She left out an important coda, though: The only people crazier are those of us who watch it.</p><p>How else to explain the continuing fascination with a reality television show in which bikini-clad women race each other in tractors on the streets of Los Angeles, and say things like, 'death is zero amount romantic'? The whole show is zero amount romantic. It is in fact the place where romance goes to die, yet I, and millions like me, continue to watch it and its spinoffs (including The Bachelorette and The Bachelor Canada. Probably I'll soon be watching The Nicobachelorette, about a smoker looking for love while she tries to quit.)</p><p>I feel as I should be standing in a church basement clutching a dirty coffee cup when I say this: I am a Bachelor addict. Like most addicts, I wish I were free. Can a proper feminist also be a fan of what is surely the most retrograde show on television, which transports its stereotypes - virgin, strumpet, Jezebel - by chuckwagon from 1860? That is a knotty question, which we'll get to in a minute.</p><p>But first The Bachelor, now in its 19th season, still a ratings blockbuster on Monday nights for ABC; it generates spin-offs, books, specials and enough on-screen tears to float a Disney cruise ship. If you've been watching (don't be shy, we're all blameless sinners here), you'll know that the current Bachelor is Chris Soules, a.k.a. 'Prince Farming.' Mr. Soules is a farmer from Iowa, and his heart is as full of kindness as his head is empty of thoughts. Despite this, and the fact that he lives near nothing but corn, some 30 women were willing to drink warm goat's milk and swim through mud to win his hand.</p><p>That number has been winnowed to three, thanks to a feral process in which the women competed with each other over who had the most 'amazing connection' to a man they'd known for six weeks. The show, always barmy, has devolved into a journey to the lost city of crazy, with one contestant attempting to leverage her recent widowhood into a trip to the altar. This week, the final three contestants will each accompany the Bachelor to the 'Fantasy Suite,' which is a bit like a product-testing lab, except for sexual compatibility rather than choking hazards.</p><p>If this strikes you as having the freshness of a Blondie cartoon, that's part of the appeal. In the world of The Bachelor it is still 1962, and women with eyelashes like albatross wings fight with other women over the only thing that matters: an engagement ring. It's hugely comforting, or disturbing, depending on how you view the modern world.</p><p>Seen another way, though, The Bachelor and its sister shows are wonderfully subversive. For one thing, there is almost never a 'happily ever after.' Once the scripts have been put away and the last rose has wilted, the lovers almost invariably break up. Only a handful of the show's couples, who had once pledged their troth over a product-placement diamond, actually end up together. It's an arrow straight through the heart of the pernicious romantic myth of 'the one.' There is the one, but then there's that other one, with the glossier hair.</p><p>Can I be a good feminist and love The Bachelor, stripped of its cultural meaning, and just enjoy it as a show? Do I have to worry about the performative nature of femininity, or can I just marvel at the number of ways to spell Kaitlyn?</p><p>Or perhaps I can just accept that I am a bad feminist, as Roxane Gay writes in her excellent book with that title. Her argument is that questionable taste in music or TV or books doesn't make a person any less politically aware or capable, it just makes her human. She can enjoy hip hop, or even The Bachelor, and not let the sisterhood down. 'I have certain interests and personality traits and opinions that may not fall in line with mainstream feminism,' Ms. Gay writes, 'but I am still a feminist.'</p><p>If this were a show trial (or a reality show trial, in my case) we'd all be judged ideologically impure. And that's okay. We can spend the day kicking against the pricks, and nights wondering who gets a rose.</p>, <p>The hardest battle in our fight to save our native children is against ennui. If you haven't encountered that word before, it means something about a ton heavier and a lot deadlier than simple boredom. It means a lifelong sort of tiredness. It means lassitude, an unrelenting feeling of nothingness. It means you give up trying, dreaming or seeing yourself doing something better.</p><p>I encountered it head on recently. I was at a northern reserve to deliver a workshop called Empowering Community Through Story. It was designed to allow native youth to gather and tell stories about themselves and their community in a variety of different media. The program offered the chance to use art, photography, video and oral and written story to create a comprehensive image of their home. It would have allowed them to see and share how they viewed their reserve in the past, present and future.</p><p>Because I believe so much in the healing power of story, I created the program so that native youth would discover that stories can be told in any number of ways. I designed it so they could choose how they wanted to tell them. I aimed it right at technology and art. If I had the relevant experience, I would have used dance, theatre and music to achieve the same goals. It was a grand initiative with incredible potential for change and empowerment.</p><p>Not a single youth registered. It was a free program with no registration fee. It wasn't really their fault, because no one on the reserve got the word out. There were no posters or anything, so that when we arrived, no one was expecting us. There wasn't a single person from administration, community development or health and wellness to show us where to go. We were a special program with no participants. So months of creating and planning went down the drain and we had to create something out of nothing.</p><p>When word did get out that we were there, reserve families simply sent their young children to us so that we could act as a sort of casual daycare. The program wasn't designed for tots or those under 15, so it collapsed and became something far different. It became a face-to-face encounter with ennui.</p><p>The youngsters wanted stimulation. That was the good news. So we created an art program on the fly and got them painting, making collage and decorating hula hoops. But their level of interest and ability to concentrate and focus flagged very quickly and every art session devolved into noise and mayhem after about 30 minutes.</p><p>When I tried to get the community to show up at free lunches so I could take photographs for a community album, no one showed. When we attempted to get the health workers to arrange interviews with elders for a video that would go in their museum, no one showed - except when they knew they would be paid. Everything we tried to accomplish for that community fell flat. In the end, we created a small but vibrant community photo collage, and a short video with three elders talking and telling stories. But it was only through our energy. The community itself never showed.</p><p>When we left, there was no one there to receive the projects. There was no one interested enough to come see what we had created for them even though we'd been there for 10 days. Our bright, shiny projects that showed such hope and promise were left with no one to view them. It was sad - heartbreaking, even, because that's what's at the core of dysfunctional and ineffective reserve communities. Ennui. A thousand-pound word that means you simply just don't care any more.</p><p>It's the system that brings a people to that. It's the Indian Act. It's an imposed welfare mentality. It's generation after generation of crushing isolation and poverty. It's the deeply ingrained belief that there is nothing else possible and that no one sees us or cares about us anyway. It's the entire history of Canada and her relationship with native people focused despairingly on our most vulnerable.</p><p>It's killing us, starting with our youngest. It's foisted upon our youngsters and our youth and robs them of vision. Those kids in that art class didn't lose their focus because they weren't interested. They lost it because in the larger picture of their lives it had no place. It would end as all things end. It would flare as all promises flare and then gradually slip away never to be repeated.</p><p>Ennui. The acceptance that this is all there is and all there ever will be.

Allegedly coined to bemoan the terrible reporting that helped facilitate Mr. Trump's rise, it actually serves to stabilize his rule. 'Fake news' poses a false binary, blurring the distinction between political propaganda, intentional disinformation, attention-seeking click-bait, conspiracy theories, and sloppy reporting.</p><p>When the United States elects a man who peddles falsehoods, obfuscates critical information about his business transactions and foreign relationships, and relies on both mass media outlets and untraditional venues like conspiracy websites to maintain his power, the manifold ways he lies are as important as the lies themselves.</p><p>According to reporter Daniel Dale, Mr. Trump told at least 560 lies during the course of his campaign. Some lies are audacious in that they are easily disproven - for example, when Mr. Trump claimed he did not tell U.S. citizens to 'check out a sex tape' after tweeting to them to do so. Flagrant lying is a hallmark of despotism. It sends the message that one should not bother speaking truth to power when power is the only truth. It implies that the teller of the lie defines reality, no matter what evidence there is to the contrary, including the liar's own words.</p><p>However, Mr. Trump's most powerful lies contain a grain of truth that plays to the preconceptions of his audience. When Mr. Trump lies about the conditions of inner cities, about the economy, or about Hillary Clinton, he exploits the vulnerability of some citizens while telling others what they want to hear. These lies are propaganda: false information with a political purpose, tailored to incite.</p><p>But instead of both parsing the meaning of Mr. Trump's propaganda or searching for the critical information he refuses to disclose, much of the U.S. media has leaped on the term 'fake news' as an easy explanation for why Mr. Trump triumphed. 'Fake news' co-exists with 'post-fact world': an odd phrase to invoke when describing a candidate known for threatening journalists, forcing employees to sign non-disclosure agreements, and using libel lawsuits to intimidate critics.</p><p>If 'there's no such thing as facts' - as one of Mr. Trump's surrogates proclaimed - why does Mr. Trump's team work so hard to suppress them?</p><p>But as inauguration looms, Mr. Trump's team may not have to work too hard to keep the U.S. press in line. U.S. journalists, always his greatest ally due to corporate collaboration and fear of retaliation, are already mainstreaming the Trump administration's most inflammatory ideas. To read the U.S. media today is to see a CNN debate on whether Jews are people, the Associated Press falsely tweet that the KKK has disavowed white supremacy, and countless mainstream media puff pieces on neo-Nazis that focus more on their fashion sense than their fascist beliefs.</p><p>With hate crimes soaring, it is unnerving to see the media glamorizing or excusing extremist views. But that is where the term 'fake news' controversy becomes useful for them. An outlet criticizing fake news implies that its own news is true news. To bemoan a 'fake news' crisis bolsters one's own legitimacy, which is a dangerous thing to do when you are writing glossy profiles of people who endorse ethnic cleansing. Such coverage abets Mr. Trump's goal, which was always to pull the fringes to the centre, making the extreme mainstream.</p><p>U.S. citizens are facing a twofold assault on truth: one, of propaganda intended to change standards of what is considered normal; and two, of instilling a nihilistic helplessness in those aware of the propaganda deluge. 'LOL nothing matters' has become the catchphrase used by those peddling flagrant lies.</p><p>But do not be fooled by cynical claims that 'nothing matters.' When people are suffering, it matters. When lies enable that suffering, exposing them matters. Truth is always worth fighting for. But to get to the heart of the truth, you must examine the nature of the lie.</p>, <p>These are no longer the days of Lester Pearson, when peacekeeping was a matter of watching a quiet ceasefire line or supervising a recognized international border.</p><p>Most peacekeeping now is about trying to minimize bloodshed and create pockets of order in the midst of grim, intractable civil wars.</p><p>But in the 2015 election, the Liberals were eager for Canada to return to the glory days of Pearsonian peacekeeping, the better to strike a contrast with the Conservatives.

But it may have taken Mr. Trump's election for French elites to start taking her seriously. Suddenly, what seemed ridiculously impossible seems increasingly plausible.</p><p>Related: Trump's victory a win for Europe's populist parties as election cycle looms</p><p>Analysis: Sarkozy and the French fear factor</p><p>Opinion: Why France's Hollande is losing his grip</p><p>'The main lesson for us is that Marine Le Pen can win in France,' former centre-right prime minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin said after the U.S. election.

'Madame Frexit' had been expected to come first in April's opening round of the vote, only to succumb to an anti-Le Pen wave in a two-candidate presidential run-off election two weeks later. Her defeat no longer seems so bankable.</p><p>Much of the outcome will depend on who else is on the ballot. The main centre-right opposition party - which just changed its name to Les Republicains in part to shake off its establishment image - will elect its presidential standard-bearer in a two-round primary starting on Sunday. The favourites, Alain Juppe and Nicolas Sarkozy, are polar opposites, meaning the dynamics of the presidential race will be very different depending on which of the two wins the primary.</p><p>Mr. Juppe, a former prime minister, leads the opinion polls for both the primary and the presidential race. After the surprise Trump win, no one knows whether to believe them though, especially since no one knows who will turn out to vote in the primary. Most agree, however, that Mr. Trump's victory gives a shot in the arm to Mr. Sarkozy's flagging candidacy.</p><p>Mr. Sarkozy, the hyperactive former president booted out of office in 2012, is running, improbably, as an outsider. He attacks the elites nearly as much as Ms. Le Pen does and peddles an anti-immigration message nearly as xenophobic as her anti-Islam diatribes. Unlike Ms. Le Pen, however, he wants only to renegotiate France's European treaties, not rip them up.</p><p>Also unlike Ms. Le Pen, who vocally backed Mr. Trump from the start, Mr. Sarkozy spent most of 2016 dismissing the bombastic billionaire. 'I find it terrifying that 30 per cent of Americans can identify with that,' Mr. Sarkozy said as Mr. Trump rang up consecutive Republican Party primary wins earlier this year. This week, however, he was praising American voters for validating his own anti-elite drive to return control over France's borders to the French people.</p><p>Mr. Juppe warned, in contrast, that the U.S. vote underscored 'the risks of demagoguery and extremism' and called on French voters to take heed. His down-the-centre pitch for national unity is hauntingly similar to the fateful 'Stronger Together' slogan of Hillary Clinton's campaign. He is as beige as Ms. Clinton, with plenty of scandals on his rap sheet. And he has the backing of the French establishment to boot.</p><p>Could that spell doom against a populist politician as fiery as Ms. Le Pen? Could Mr. Sarkozy's base of small-business people and notaries opt for Ms. Le Pen if he's not on the ballot? Could left-wing voters, who have splintered among several competing factions in the face of Socialist President Francois Hollande's unpopularity, unite behind Mr. Juppe to stop Ms. Le Pen? Who knows?</p><p>For all their similarities, the differences between the French and U.S. electoral systems make Ms. Le Pen's climb steeper. The French elect their president through direct suffrage, not an electoral college, and the winner needs to capture more than 50 per cent of the vote. And French turnout is robust, with 80 per cent of eligible voters typically casting a ballot in presidential races, compared with less than 60 per cent of registered U.S. voters.</p><p>Still, with Brexit looming and Trumpism rising, only an ostrich would count Ms. Le Pen out.</p>, <p>Stephen Harper should lose sleep this week, as the Danish-owned Nordic Orion becomes the first cargo vessel to use the Northwest Passage as an international shipping route - at no little risk to Canada's environment and sovereignty.</p><p>Last week, the crash of a Coast Guard helicopter in the Northwest Passage underlined how very dangerous Arctic waters can be. The three men on board were wearing survival suits. They escaped the aircraft before it sank but froze to death in the hour it took for the icebreaker Amundsen to reach them.</p><p>Although the Nordic Orion is ice-strengthened, Arctic storms, shallow waters and icebergs still pose risks. Small chunks of icebergs called 'growlers' are extremely hard, float low in the water, and are difficult to spot. In 2007, the ice-strengthened MS Explorer sank during an Antarctic voyage after striking a growler. Then there is 'icing', which occurs when ocean spray freezes onto the superstructure of a ship, causing it to become top-heavy and capsize.</p><p>Canada's Arctic search-and-rescue capabilities are desperately poor. Our long-range helicopters are based in British Columbia, Nova Scotia and Labrador: each aircraft would take more than a day to fly the 2,500 kilometers to the Northwest Passage, stopping to refuel along the way.</p><p>C-130 Hercules planes can be sent from southern Canada, but unlike helicopters, cannot hoist people on board. Worse yet, the Hercules used for search and rescue are nearly half a century old and often un-deployable for maintenance reasons. An attempt to procure replacements began in 2002, but eleven years later, no construction contract has been signed.</p><p>As a point of comparison, Russia has several search-and-rescue stations in the Arctic and is building ten more - each with its own ships and aircraft.</p><p>Canada lacks a single port along the Northwest Passage in which a vessel could seek refuge in the event of mechanical problems or a serious storm. Russia has sixteen deep-water ports along its Arctic coastline.</p><p>It is time to implement the long-standing plan to transform a disused wharf on Baffin Island into an all-year naval base. And to build other ports, perhaps at the communities of Tuktoyaktuk and Iqaluit, where they could serve double duty.</p><p>A major investment in charting is required. In 2010, John Falkingham told the Nunatsiaq News that inadequate charts are the 'single biggest issue in the Arctic.' Mr. Falkingham, who spent three decades in the Canadian Ice Service, explained that only one-tenth of Canada's Arctic waters are charted to modern standards.</p><p>In 1996, an ice-strengthened cruise ship went aground on a sand bar near Gjoa Haven, Nunavut. In 2010, another cruise ship ran onto an underwater ledge near Kugluktuk, Nunavut.</p><p>Then there are the environmental risks. The coal being carried by the Nordic Orion would not cause much damage in the event of an accident. But the fuel oil on board the vessel certainly would. In 2004, a Malaysian cargo ship lost power during a storm off the south coast of Alaska. The vessel was blown aground and broke apart, spilling 1.2 million litres of fuel oil. Almost none of the oil was recovered due to the remote location, bad weather, and the near-complete absence of oil spill clean-up equipment and personnel.</p><p>Russia is prepared for these situations, with dozens of powerful icebreakers that it uses to escort foreign cargo ships. Canada's Coast Guard icebreakers are growing old, and most are too small and underpowered for convoy duty. There are plans for only one new vessel, but again, no construction contract has been signed. The Navy has no ice-capable ships whatsoever, and the planned Arctic/Offshore Patrol Vessels have fallen years behind schedule.</p><p>The Nordic Orion will not undermine Canada's legal position that the Northwest Passage constitutes internal waters, since the ship has registered its voyage with the Canadian Coast Guard - thereby seeking and receiving permission from Canada. But other ships will follow, and their compliance with Canada's domestic laws - and therefore our ability to ensure safety and environmental protection - cannot be assumed.</p><p>The best way to promote Canada's legal position is to provide infrastructure and essential services. International shipping companies will register their voyages if doing so will ensure their access to icebreaking, world-class search and rescue, weather and ice forecasting, and ports of refuge.</p><p>It is also time to seize the diplomatic initiative - and discuss the Northwest Passage with the United States, which has to be worried about the possibility that smugglers, illegal immigrants and even terrorists might use the Northwest Passage to access North America. Some Americans have already realized that these challenges are best addressed through a coastal state's domestic laws, rather than the much weaker powers available under international law in a so-called 'international strait'.</p><p>Is Canada a serious Arctic country? Are we a responsible coastal state? Are we a reliable ally of the United States? These are the questions the Prime Minister should ask himself, as he lies awake this week.</p><p>Michael Byers holds the Canada Research Chair in Global Politics and International Law at the University of British Columbia. He is the author of International Law and the Arctic, recently published by Cambridge University Press.</p>, <p>It's so very easy to defend the freedom of speech of those we agree with. It requires no particular courage or intellectual rigour. And so all those who are critical of newspapers, like this one, that have chosen not to publish the more inflammatory cartoons of the French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo are having a terrific little time right now. They have nothing on the line as they gleefully accuse the media of heinous shortcomings in the emotional aftermath of the murders of most of Charlie Hebdo's senior editorial masthead.</p><p>Newspapers and TV stations - and, somehow by extension, their reporters - are called cowardly because they won't print or broadcast images they consider offensive. They are labelled appeasers on the grounds they are buckling under to rioters in the Islamic world who protest the publication of images considered blasphemous. 'Terrorism works,' say the critics who believe the sole reason an outlet would refuse to publish an offensive Charlie Hebdo cartoon is out of fear of retaliation.</p><p>How incredibly easy. How crass and pompous.</p><p>There are 12 people dead in Paris, murdered because the editors and cartoonists at Charlie Hebdo stuck to their editorial guns. They printed what was their right to print, even though many wished they didn't. The government of France at one point tried to get them to tone down their provocations. But after the offices of Charlie Hebdo were firebombed by Islamist extremists in 2011, the government gave the magazine police protection. The government supported the right of Charlie Hebdo to publish what it wanted, even though it disagreed with the content. That was courage. That took intelligence.</p><p>What doesn't require courage or intelligence is demanding proof of one's solidarity with the victims of the Paris massacre by reprinting their most offensive material. The right of Charlie Hebdo, and all the Charlie Hebdos of the world, to publish provocative, offensive, satirical cartoons must be backed without reservation. But so too must the right of other publications to make different choices - namely to defend Charlie Hebdo without embracing and endorsing everything the satirical newspaper ever did, or holding its work up as canon.</p><p>The Globe and Mail, along with The New York Times, the CBC and many other media outlets, last week chose not to reprint Charlie Hebdo's deliberately provocative cartoons. We made the same decision in 2006 after a Danish magazine was threatened by extremists for publishing cartoons depicting Mohammed as a terrorist. Both decisions were made in accordance with the newspaper's beliefs and values. Charlie Hebdo's editors lived by their values, and died for them. If there is a better way to honour them than by doing the same thing, we don't know what it is.</p>, <p>He was supposed to be the guy who would be measured with his words, the one who had to stay above the fray.</p><p>Stephen Harper's use of the expression 'old-stock Canadians' added an odd twist to Thursday's leaders' debate, clouding his attempts at being statesman-like.</p><p>Detractors talked about dog whistling. Supporters Googled past occasions when Liberals said the same thing. And people whose forebears didn't land in Canada until the 20th century just felt awkward or annoyed.</p><p>'Old stock' is not a common utterance in current Canadian public discourse, but veterans of Quebec's tumultuous politics of the 1990s will remember the words and the debate - that is how the expression 'Quebecois de souche' was usually translated into English.</p><p>Quebec politicians struggled to find acceptable ways to describe the descendants of the French-speaking pioneers of the 17th century. As inclusive as they tried to be, the separatist leaders could not avoid talking about the newcomers and the others because much of the debate stemmed from Quebec's distinctive history and demographics.</p><p>Jacques Parizeau, no fan of political correctness, felt that there was nothing wrong with pointing out statistical realities, such as the fact that non-francophones wouldn't vote for his party.</p><p>We know how badly that ended, one night in the fall of 1995, when he was supposed to calm the crowd but instead gave way to his anger.</p><p>Liberals at the time were not immune to racial gaffes either.</p><p>I have written in the past about how, that same year, while I was chatting with the columnist Chantal Hebert at a reception in Ottawa, then-prime minister, Jean Chretien, walked by and asked, with a grin: 'Are you trying to solve China's problems?'</p><p>There was no ill will on his part. Though obviously, since Chantal isn't Chinese, he didn't see me foremost as a member of the press corps, but someone with yellow skin.</p><p>It depends on the context, of course. Any newcomer knows that when they are asked 'Where are you from?' the question could either be queried out of friendly curiosity or uttered with animosity and resentment.</p><p>Look for example at the time Justin Trudeau also used the expression 'old stock.'</p><p>It was in 2007, in an interview with the community weekly Nouvelles Parc-Extension News, where he explained that he opposed Mr. Harper's motion to recognize that 'the Quebecois' form a nation. He asked if everyone in Quebec was part of that nation or whether it was just for the 'old stock.'</p><p>His words were controversial at the time because he opposed the motion, not because of the way he described a segment of the Quebec population. Those who weren't 'old stock' didn't mind it, since he was speaking up for them.</p><p>Was Mr. Harper deliberately sending a message?</p><p>Or, even if it was an off-the-cuff choice of words, was it a slip that revealed the speaker's hidden fear of the Other?</p><p>It certainly reminded some viewers that they were the Other. Their anger was genuine, not a pearl-clutching act. 'I couldn't even sleep last night I was so pissed [off],' one friend, a Canadian of Jamaican origin, said.</p><p>Mr. Harper's controversial remark came after he was asked about denying health care for refugees.</p><p>'The only time we've removed it is where we have clearly bogus refugee claimants who have been refused and turned down. We do not offer them a better health care plan than the ordinary Canadian can receive,' he said.</p><p>'I think that's something that most new and existing and, and, old-stock Canadians agree with.'</p><p>Lost in the controversy is the fact that Mr. Harper's comment about health-care coverage was inaccurate. The cut affected not only rejected refugee claimants but also claimants from what the government designates as 'safe countries.'</p><p>One can hear, watching that video clip again, that Mr. Harper hesitates and searches for words: '... and, and, old-stock Canadians.' But the essence of it was that Mr. Harper was trying to say that even newcomers would agree with him.</p><p>That was always the way the Conservatives made their pitch to minority voters - by drawing a line between the law-abiding ones, whose social values also happened to be conservative, and the others, those who were portrayed as queue-jumping terrorist-sympathizing bogus asylum seekers.</p><p>It was about us and the others, even if the line wasn't meant to be drawn along racial lines.</p><p>But the reaction was predictable because the Conservatives had been pressing that button before. By trying to ban the niqab from citizenship ceremonies while fundraising on the issue. By raising fears about terrorism. By retaining Lynton Crosby, an operative associated with emotionally-charged campaigning tactics in Australia and Britain.</p><p>They had played that game before, and those who already didn't like the Conservatives weren't going to give them the benefit of the doubt.</p>, <p>A lot of Canadians are worried about whether someone like Donald Trump could become prime minister. Given that political trends can cross borders as easily as acid rain, it's not impossible. Kellie Leitch sure is giving it the old college try. But the rise of Mr. Trump is only half the story of America's sudden political upheaval. The other half is the collapse of Hillary Clinton.</p><p>If I were Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, I'd be carefully considering what made Ms. Clinton toxic for so many voters. A lot of it was about the economy. Much of it was out of her control. But some of it was her own handiwork. Exhibit A: Her fundraising, and that of the Clinton Foundation, the latter featuring foreign donors and vague but suspicious connections running from government to the foundation and back again.</p><p>Opinion: Like Trudeau, Liberal MPs just want fundraising controversy to end</p><p>Globe editorial: Justin Trudeau's latest cash-for-access explanation is worse than the last</p><p>Related: Justin Trudeau says he uses cash-for-access fundraisers to champion the middle class</p><p>The parallels with recent revelations about Mr. Trudeau and his party are hard to miss. Donors writing cheques in return for face-time with senior politicians? Check. The appearance of conflict of interest? Check. A foundation bearing Mr. Trudeau's name, with relationships to his family and his government, raising money from foreign donors? Check. And all of it legal? Almost certainly, and almost certainly irrelevant.</p><p>The amounts of cash involved are far smaller in Canada than in the United States because our political fundraising laws really are stricter than those down south. That's been one of Mr. Trudeau's defences and he's not entirely wrong. But regardless of the amounts, the principles at stake are the same, as are the dangers for the Prime Minister. For a political leader, public trust is the oxygen of elected life. You can't survive without it.</p><p>A lot of U.S. voters came to believe Ms. Clinton represented corruption in politics. The charge was hugely overblown, and relative to Mr. Trump, who loudly celebrates his conflicts of interest, it was absurd. But it had something to it and it stuck.</p><p>Mr. Trudeau can take steps to eliminate the possibility of voters buying such a charge, or he can let the material with which to build a case mount up.</p><p>To eliminate the problem, the PM would have to do two things. First, change the rules around political fundraising, removing the temptation to sell political access. And second, remove himself, his family and the Government of Canada from the operations of the Trudeau Foundation. Make the perception of conflict of interest impossible by eliminating the possibility of actual conflict.</p><p>Thanks to former prime ministers Jean Chretien and Stephen Harper, unions and corporations are already banned from donating to federal politicians, and individuals are limited to a combined total contribution to parties and candidates of just over $3,000 a year. But that's still a lot of money, which is why access can still be sold. Dropping the maximum donation to just $100 would fix that. It would put cash-for-access out of business.</p><p>Then there's the Pierre Elliott Trudeau Foundation. Because the former PM's son is now the current PM - not something anticipated back in 2001 - the foundation's unorthodox, public-private partnership structure raises the potential for conflicts of interest. The only victim of any public perception of a conflict would be the Prime Minister himself.</p><p>The foundation was created by Mr. Chretien, who gave it $125-million of taxpayer money. But the Trudeau family were given an ongoing say in its governance, including seats on the board. (Mr. Trudeau stepped aside several years ago; his brother remains.) The Industry Ministry, whose minister serves at the PM's pleasure, also nominates board members. And the foundation, despite its wealth, seeks private donations. Earlier this year, two Chinese businessmen donated $200,000; one of them, who has met with Mr. Trudeau, is president of the China Cultural Industry Association, which is overseen by China's government. Is this illegal? No. But it looks terrible. And fixing it would be easy.</p><p>To avoid even the perception of conflict of interest, Mr. Trudeau can announce that the foundation will have no connection to him, his family or his government. That means no family or government appointees. Make it clear that the foundation's work is entirely about the former PM's legacy - and has no connection to the current PM.</p>, <p>In the early 1990s, a psychologist named Robert Plomin began a wide-ranging study whose results are upending everything we thought we knew about the roots of human behaviour. He began to study twins. He wasn't the first in the field, but today he is the most influential.</p><p>Twins come in two types: identical, which means they share all their genes; and fraternal, which means they share no more genes than any other siblings. They present a natural experiment in why people differ, and the influences of nurture versus nature. Bottom line: Genetics is important everywhere we look - not just in height and hair colour but also in behaviour. 'A good general guess is that genetics explains 50 per cent of the differences in people in terms of personality, vocational interest, depression,' Dr. Plomin says. 'That's a huge amount of explanatory power.'</p><p>Today, spectacular advances in molecular genetics are producing an explosion of new information about how our genome shapes us. Harvard psychologist Steven Pinker predicts that these findings will fundamentally reshape our understanding of human nature. They may also reshape our thinking on everything from parenting and education to broader social policy.</p><p>No doubt you've read those stories about identical twins who were separated at birth but grew up to be uncannily alike. My favourite is the story of Jack Yufe and Oskar Stohr, separated when they were six months old. Jack, raised in Trinidad as a Jew, later joined Israel's navy as an officer. Oscar, who grew up in Nazi Germany, was Catholic and a member of the Hitler Youth.</p><p>But the similarities were even more striking than their differences. Both were hot-tempered, impatient and demanding. They preferred to read books back to front. They flushed toilets before and after using them. Both had dreams about killing the other in war. When they met in later life, both showed up wearing white sports jackets and wire-rimmed glasses.</p><p>Here's just some of what the new genetic science has shown:</p><p>* Serious disorders once thought to be wholly psychological in origin are now known to be organic. Autism was thought to be a developmental disorder caused by bad parenting. Schizophrenia was blamed on 'refrigerator mothers.' Now we know from twin studies that both autism and schizophrenia have a strong genetic component, as do learning disabilities.</p><p>* The effects of family socialization on your children's personalities, as Brian Boutwell and Razib Khan write in Quillette, 'are not large, not prominent and not pronounced.' What you do (or don't do) to your kids has no influence on their innate intelligence, their temperament and personality traits, or their interests. Spank or don't spank, read to them or not - it really doesn't matter. You can, of course, make a difference if you save up all your money to send your kid to Harvard, or try to teach your antisocial miscreant anger-management techniques. But you can't change who they are. Your greatest influence on their lives was the moment you rolled the dice and bequeathed your and your partner's genes to them.</p><p>*Intelligence (as Dr. Plomin and others wrote in an influential piece in Nature) is 'one of the best predictors of important life outcomes such as education, occupation, mental and physical health and illness, and mortality.' Intelligence, one of the most heritable behavioural traits, is also an important factor in class differences. Intelligent people are healthier, happier and stay married longer. They are also likely to marry each other and produce intelligent children. The implications for inequality and social mobility are significant.</p><p>It's easy to see why this stuff is so explosive. It sounds so fatalistic! The idea of innate differences is anathema to many people who value equality. If genes are so important, what happens to our efforts to create social justice? What happens to our notions of social reform progress? There's also the grim spectre of the past. Genetic determinism has been linked with some of the vilest chapters in recent history.</p><p>No wonder many people - especially social scientists, feminists, and progressive politicians - think behavioural genetics is a Pandora's box that should be slammed shut as soon as possible. They remain heavily invested in cultural determinism - the idea that your environment, not your origins, makes you who you are, and also that the right social policies can significantly change the outcomes.</p><p>But genetic denialism has its own risks. One risk is that by not acknowledging the importance of heritability, a lot of social science research is misleading and useless. And many of the policies it has inspired won't work.</p><p>Today the social sciences face a deepening crisis of legitimacy - largely because social scientists, who are overwhelmingly liberal, can't bring themselves to acknowledge what's staring them in the face. Yet good social policy depends on it. Dr. Plomin believes this is especially true in education, which should be both more effective and more humane. 'It does poor service to social change to subordinate truth to politics,' he says.</p><p>With the revolutionary new techniques that have been developed for exploring the human genome, the cascade of findings in behavioural genetics will be increasingly difficult to ignore. They'll be controversial, but also liberating. Meanwhile, you can focus on the good news: Whatever's wrong with your kids is probably not your fault.</p>, <p>If Canada's other national sport is feeling superior to Americans, then 2016 is the game's golden age. Watching Donald Trump carry his sideshow to the centre stage of U.S. politics is making us all feel more than a bit smug. Because of course something like that could never, ever happen here. A Canadian Trump? Impossible.</p><p>Don't be so sure. A year and a half ago, most American pundits, not to mention the grandees of the Republican Party, felt the same. They expected Mr. Trump to be quickly and safely returned to his day job in reality television.</p><p>But the forces that powered Mr. Trump to the GOP nomination, and that still give him a shot at the presidency, are not uniquely American. His campaign is appealing to voters who believe that the people in power, including the people running the party they've traditionally supported, not only do not care about them, but don't even speak their language. They feel that political correctness has shut down their ability to express what's bugging them. They feel that their country no longer belongs to them culturally and no longer benefits them economically.</p><p>Trump's true believers: How he's gone farther than Europe's far right, and who got him there</p><p>Through the looking glass: the many faces of Trump and his fans</p><p>Fair or not, these kinds of frustrations are, to some extent, common among large parts of the population in every Western democracy - though who and what they're mad at, and why, varies. Canada's economy and history are different enough from the United States that a clone of Mr. Trump couldn't get elected here: How many people are going to vote for a guy pitching a border wall to cure an illegal immigration problem that Canada doesn't have? But someone Trump-like who attaches himself to more relevant grievances, real or imagined, will have a shot.</p><p>Because of slavery, Jim Crow and desegregation, race and racial fears have long been at the heart of U.S. politics. In recent years, the country's economic changes have fallen hardest on white, blue-collar men, creating a perfect combination of real economic difficulties married to imaginary racial causes. That's why Mr. Trump's promise to keep out illegal immigrants, rip up trade agreements and thereby somehow bring back manufacturing jobs, appeals to so many. He may not have answers, but he is naming what many voters see as their problems.</p><p>Canada has a very different history. The spectre of race doesn't hang over it. And immigration is far less controversial here because it is orderly, with immigrants chosen abroad, rather than showing up unannounced. As for illegal immigration, we have very little.</p><p>That's why a Canadian Trump probably would not mine racial paranoia. But that still leaves lots of resentments and frustrations - economic and cultural - waiting to be harnessed.</p><p>Just look at what happened in the last federal election, when the Conservatives decided to double down on plans to ban the niqab at citizenship ceremonies. The gambit may not have saved Stephen Harper from electoral defeat, but the party had polling that suggested its proposal was popular. It was never about shutting down or even reducing immigration. But it was an attempt to shine a light of disapproval on one very small group of people - as a way of signalling to many other voters that, under the Tories, immigrants would adapt to Canadian culture, not the other way around.</p><p>Or consider Toronto's late mayor Rob Ford. He came into office on a campaign that was in many ways Trumpian, but without the racism. If anything, Mr. Ford transcended race. He was most popular in the horseshoe of poorer suburbs around the wealthier centre of the city, including neighbourhoods with few people of his complexion. He ran against the alleged downtown elites, the lefties and pinkos at City Hall who were supposedly wasting everyone else's money on their own private gravy train.</p><p>Mr. Ford said he could cut taxes while building 'subways, subways, subways,' which is kind of like promising to remain stone-cold sober while chugging Dom Perignon. Pledging to improve public transit for his long-suffering constituents, while cutting the transit budget, did not add up. But his appeal was never about the details of his platform. He was selling empathy for shared resentments, not carefully mapped out solutions.</p><p>His connection to voters was visceral and cultural. And the medium - Mr. Ford himself - was the message. So it goes with Mr. Trump. So it will go with the next Canadian politician who figures out the formula and follows in their footsteps.</p>, <p>Gordon Gibson is the author of A New Look at Canadian Indian Policy. ggibson@bc-home.com</p><p>The Prime Ministerial nose must be twitching, the spine tingling, dampened finger held in the air the better to test the winds. Is this the time? Arguably, we are at a textbook moment for the calling of a snap election.</p><p>This is one of the highest risk/reward chances a First Minister can take. Pauline Marois did it and lost, big time. Kathleen Wynne did it and won, though her hand was forced. My old boss, Pierre Trudeau, did it in 1968 and overwhelmingly swept the country.</p><p>Ironically in this moment the stage has been set by Justin Trudeau. His remarks over the deployment of jet fighters to Iraq have revealed again a streak of youthful foolishness and adventurism that we saw in the severing of wise old Senators from his caucus (who would surely advised against this latest folly had they still been in the room) and the wholly unnecessary rousing and partisan cloaking of the abortion issue. The public and even the editorial page of this newspaper are openly wondering about his judgment.</p><p>This could hardly be better for Mr. Harper, who is facing a tough electoral quandry. People are rather tired of him, and looking for somebody new and younger. (The Prime Minister is only 55 but has been around for a long time. He has whatever is the ageist component of gravitats.)</p><p>The voting intention numbers in the polls have been stubbornly stuck for months at about 40 for the Libs, 30 for the Conservatives, 20 for the NDs and 10 for the odds and ends. Those figures spell the end of a Conservative government if crystallized in an election. And it will obviously take something big to move the numbers. The moment may have arrived.</p><p>The issue of Canada joining the likes of the United States, Britain, France, Australia, the Netherlands and some Arab countries in an aerial assault on the forces of the barbarous Islamic State is a big one. Mr. Harper properly called a Parliamentary vote on it, though by convention he didn't have to. Perhaps he was setting a trap? After all he didn't brief the opposition privately on his reasons, which is the right thing to do in such cases. He just put it to them, which caused Mr. Trudeau to take much offence. But sometimes better to sit there and take it.</p><p>Instead he walked into a trap. He caused his party to vote against joining the coalition, even for a very limited time with minimalist exposure of soldiers and military assets. This at a time when, according to one public poll, a full 64 per cent of Canadians want this done. This was a foolish number to ignore, but he did it. Liberal grandees such as former foreign minister Lloyd Axworthy and former leader Bob Rae are appalled. Senior MP Irwin Cotler very pointedly abstained on the vote. The Liberals are currently on the wrong side of history, as most see it.</p><p>It takes 36 days to hold a national election. Yes, according to the law it is scheduled to happen only a year from now, but that law has a loophole big enough to flip a CF-18 through. Now, think about how that election might unfold if called now.</p><p>The election themes to be set by Mr. Harper, if he could make it stick, is 'Our troops must know the people back them no matter what the Liberals and New Democrats say! Fight the most deadly and disgusting and dangerous force in the world which has suddenly appeared in Syria and Iraq and must be stopped!' and, 'Canada does not leave it for others to do the heavy lifting. That is not the Canadian way.'</p><p>The days and weeks pass by. The jet fighters are slowly deployed to the Middle East, no casualties yet, a few sorties flown. IS atrocities grow more horrific by the day and their ground troops are not rolled back. The resolve of the allies strengthens. All of this dominates the media. (Oh,...all except for new and plausible budget and tax-cut promises in the Fall Economic Statement.)</p><p>Poor Mr. Muclcair, who surely must be one of the most frustrated politicians ever in the country given his high hopes and hard work, would run about the country promising a better left wing world and secretly hoping to hold on to a more pacifist Quebec.</p><p>Mr. Trudeau would be left with flashing his sunny smile and explaining how a non-kinetic (as the soldiers say) activity like humanitarian aid is really the best way to fight this menace, and besides, have I told you the rest of my program?</p><p>This particular Canada-in-the-world concern has the legs to dominate a campaign of just a few weeks. This looks like Mr. Harper's best shot unless he has some very secret platform plans that might compare. Will he roll the dice?</p>, <p>Steven Fletcher, the Conservative MP from Winnipeg, has done Canada a service. In March, he introduced two private member's bills to allow physician-assisted suicide. His bills rekindled the embers of a national debate. If they ever reach the Commons for a vote, attention will again be focused on an issue that refuses to go away.</p><p>Mr. Fletcher has a personal authenticity on the subject, not that he wishes assisted suicide for himself. He knows suffering, having become a quadriplegic after a terrible accident. Bravely, he ran for Parliament and was elected. Bravely, he now presents these bills, knowing that they will not find favour at the highest reaches of his party, nor with a majority of his caucus colleagues.</p><p>The first bill would define how consent by individuals would be given to assisted suicide and exculpate physicians for their assistance. The second would create a commission on physician-assisted death. It would provide information to the general public and to individuals and families wishing to pursue physician-assisted death.</p><p>Canada has been around the issue of physician-assisted suicide many times in the past two decades. There have been legislative initiatives and there have been court cases (including at the Supreme Court of Canada), but we have never arrived at a consensus to allow the practice, as some European countries have done.</p><p>Quebec's recent legislative initiative came closest to success. A bill introduced by the Parti Quebecois government would have allowed physician-assisted suicide with a range of appropriate safeguards and checks involving patients, physicians and families.</p><p>The PQ lost the election, but the bill had garnered widespread political support. It is entirely possible that the new Liberal government might reintroduce the bill, or something close to it. With a legislative majority and obvious support from at least the PQ (and perhaps the other two parties), the Quebec Liberals could take the Canadian legislative lead. (The federal Liberals endorsed decriminalization of physician-assisted suicide at their last convention, but it's too soon to tell whether the party will include the idea in its election platform.)</p><p>Doctors' associations appear split on assisted suicide, judging from polling and resolutions debated and voted upon in general assemblies of physicians. There certainly is no consensus among the medical professions. It's not an easy moral and professional question for many doctors, who understandably wish the issue would just go away. But it won't.</p><p>As Canada's population ages, more people will be stricken with incurable diseases, from which will flow questions about what is called the 'right to die.' There is no such 'right' in the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, but there is a 'right' to 'security of the person,' which, under a certain construction, could be used to make assisted suicide a legal right.</p><p>We shall see whether the Supreme Court, which once turned down assisted suicide in the Rodriguez case, is prepared to reconsider. A case from British Columbia (Carter et al v. Canada) is headed to a Supreme Court with different judges in place and more time to have taken stock of public attitudes.</p><p>As with the legalization of marijuana, assisted suicide is slowly gaining ground in the United States, where several states have policies. Legal challenges to permit the practice are moving forward in other states.</p><p>A few other countries, including the Netherlands, Belgium and Switzerland, have laws governing euthanasia or assisted suicide - laws that have often been cited by those pressing for change in Canada. It should be noted that the number of people using these laws is a tiny fraction of the total deaths each year. Assisted suicides have been few in number. The notion that there are massive numbers of people choosing to use this avenue is misguided.</p><p>With all appropriate safeguards in place, as they are in jurisdictions where the practice is legal, assisted suicide is a humane addition to individual rights and the dignity of the person. Is it controversial? Yes. Should it be debated again? Yes. It cannot be ignored.</p>, <p>If this week were a menu item at Tim Hortons, it would have to be called 'the crispy hot mess sandwich.' There it was, our secular church, our carbohydrate campground, caught in the cruel pincers of fate - or, if you prefer a metaphor more pertinent to its dilemma, mired in tar sands. I like to think of it as a tempest in a Tims cup.</p><p>It should have been a good week for Tims. Wednesday was devoted to its admirable project of sending underprivileged kids to summer camp. Friday was National Doughnut Day and while the holiest day in the fried-pastry calendar has its roots in the United States, it has celebrants in Canada as well.</p><p>Unfortunately, the sacrament of the Timbit was interrupted by a schism that rocked the church. A group of activists took umbrage at glossy Enbridge ads extolling the wonders of fossil fuel, which Tims customers could choose to watch (or not) as they waited for their neon confectionary. Some 28,000 people signed a petition asking Tims to remove the ads from their restaurants - or else. 'A public outcry will let Timmies know that it can't get away with shilling tar sands without us coming together to stop it,' the petition read. Bowing to this pressure, Tim Hortons agreed to stop running the Enbridge ads.</p><p>Quite wonderfully, at least for lovers of farce, Canada's conservatives decided that they had found a cause worth fighting for; Tims was the hill they would die on. It was D-Day all over again, except here 'd' would stand for double-glazed, or possibly double-double.</p><p>As Buzzfeed Canada revealed, it was conservative political strategist Stephen Taylor who hyped the hashtag #BoycottTims on Twitter, enlisting the high-profile support of three ministers of the government, Pierre Poilievre, Michelle Rempel and Jason Kenney. It was actually a bit of a relief to see them speak out; in the deafening silence following the Truth and Reconciliation Commission report, I was a bit worried that all Tory ministers were felled by some wasting disease and lost their voices. But once a truly important matter arose in public debate, they made themselves heard; it was a Tims miracle.</p><p>The coffee-crushing juggernaut did not end there. Other powerful fans of the oil sands and the Alberta energy sector vowed they would also take snit leave, and not darken Tims' doors again. Rebel Media's Ezra Levant organized a Boycott Tims rally in Calgary, which appeared to draw more journalists than protesters; Brian Jean, the Leader of Alberta's Wildrose Party, channelled the spirit of Thomas Paine: 'I'll pick up my Tims coffee again when they decide to apologize for taking jabs at our industry, which is so important to Albertans.'</p><p>It may not have occurred to the organizers of the Tims boycott that it could very well backfire. A certain number of Canadians will find Tim Hortons infinitely more welcoming if they are unlikely to encounter Mr. Levant or Conservative cabinet members there. In fact, Tims could adapt this as an advertising slogan, in the way that some candy manufacturers lure allergy-alert parents with the promise '100 per cent nut-free.'</p><p>The Boycott Tims movement now has a petition of its own, which is quite sweet. It is raising money to buy radio ads, and perhaps those ads will warn of the dangers of marijuana use and national child care, thus killing a bunch of birds with one stone. Most valiantly, it is recommending alternatives to Tims, including Starbucks. This cannot be easy, for everyone knows that crossing Starbucks's threshold increases the likelihood of turning a regular joe-drinking Joe into a latte-lover, with its commitment risks of listening to the CBC and reading Margaret Atwood. Careful, fellas, is all I would say. It's a foamy slope out there.</p><p>The land of boycotts is a crowded one - so crowded, in fact, that there is an app called Buycott that you can swipe over a barcode to determine just how morally soiled or pristine a particular product is. The Ethical Consumer website lists dozens of ongoing boycotts, against everything from Air France to Coca-Cola to the country of Botswana, for a variety of transgressions against animal rights, labour rights, equality rights and more. I honestly have no idea how the site's curators will fit the Tims boycott into that list. My feeling is that they will stare at it for a while, shake their heads and mutter: 'Canada. What the hell.'</p><p>As well, boycotts are a notoriously useless gimmick, unless the target is large, plain and evil (e.g. South Africa's apartheid regime). I'm not sure the obscure corner where Canadian culture, politics and snacking meet will fit those criteria.</p><p>A quick glance at my local Tims revealed that it was as packed as ever. The chatty elderly colonized one corner, as they always do until the manager hustles them out the door at night and locks it quickly behind them. There were hooky-playing teens and exhausted new parents and happy new Canadians. The church will survive. When the wafers are this good, why go elsewhere?</p>, <p>There's a good chance you returned to an old flame over the holidays, figures suggest. But was something awakened in you?</p><p>I'm referring, of course, to Star Wars: The Force Awakens - a force in the universe so strong that it drew people back to that old love, the movie theatre, after years of neglect. This week it became the highest-grossing film of all time in North America.</p><p>Many of you have probably been involved in a new, comfortable situation - holed up under the covers at home with Netflix (and perhaps BitTorrent, shame on you). In 2014, attendance at North American movie theatres hit a nearly two-decade low. Things are expected to bounce back somewhat this year; The Force Awakens is obviously a factor.</p><p>The film presented an enormous opportunity. Here was a chance for theatres to woo back audiences, by showing them what they've been missing. Think midnight mass: You've got a once-a-year audience packed into the pews and you want to be welcoming and impressive enough that they'll consider returning on some regular Sunday.</p><p>So this reunion with the theatre for Star Wars should have been an easy and spectacular encounter. Perhaps you discovered that it wasn't.</p><p>You may have wondered what the heck D-Box 3-D UltraAVX Atmos was, and why it cost $23.50 per ticket - or how it differed from UltraAVX 3-D, regular 3-D, or just 'regular.' Perhaps you balked, as I did, at the $46.38 spent on popcorn and sugary drinks - a total that did not seem to reflect the fact that you ordered family members to share, and even applied your Scene Card discount.</p><p>That's when you, who have not been to the theatre in some time, were introduced to the fresh hell of the self-serve beverage machine. (Depending on your location.) You may have been surprised, after lining up for popcorn, when the person behind the counter handed over paper cups that were, alas, empty and directed you and your brood over to yet another line-up.</p><p>There you performed a balancing act - popcorn, children, movie tickets - while you searched for space on the inadequately sized counter and selected from infinite flavour offerings on a touch screen that may have thrilled your seven-year-old, but probably provoked a different reaction in you, the thirsty adult breaking out into a sweat as the queue behind you grew ever longer.</p><p>There are some aspects of the movie-theatre experience that are beyond the theatre's control: the bathroom stall spoilers (it happened to us), the play-by-play plot-breakdown whispers from the couple behind you, the last-bit-of-pop slurpers at key emotional moments, the Tommy Texters.</p><p>But 15 minutes (approx.) of commercials? After living through those inane interactive quizzes? Followed by a similarly long block of trailers? While I did thoroughly enjoy a mock trailer for Chicken Squad - an ad from the B.C. Chicken Marketing Board - one line from it seemed to sum up the endurance test of this movie-going experience: 'Oh, cluck.'</p><p>It seems to me if they want to lure audiences back to the theatres and away from their couches and all the binge-watching they can manage for $9.99 a month, exhibitors are going to have to do better. Otherwise it's just too easy to stay home and watch Making a Murderer or 134 episodes of The Good Wife.</p><p>A film diet consumed entirely at home is a viable option, with a film and TV landscape that is pretty much unrecognizable from the previous time a Star Wars movie whisked us to a galaxy far, far away.</p><p>On iTunes, you can already order recent blockbusters such as The Martian or Mad Max: Fury Road - both of which are up for Best Picture awards at this weekend's Golden Globes and are likely to score Oscar nominations when they're announced on Thursday.</p><p>In 2015, Netflix subscribers watched 42.5 billion hours of programming. This week, Netflix announced a huge global expansion into more than 130 new countries (with the notable exception of China - and they're working on that). 'You are witnessing the birth of a global TV network,' said chief executive officer Reed Hastings.</p><p>That birth comes with all kinds of potential carnage. In Canada, pick-and-pay, cord-cutting (and cord-nevers - people who have never subscribed to cable and don't plan to) are of grave concern to cable and satellite providers and the television industry. A report out this week predicts funding and job losses with the great cable unbundling to come - even a threat to the survival of some Canadian channels.</p><p>Sure, giant releases such as Star Wars and 3-D technology you can't get at home will always be a draw. But if it's unpleasant at the multiplex, it's pretty easy to just stay home; there's always something to watch. I love going to the movies, and I hate being a Marsha Moaner, but I fear the industry is losing the plot - and is in danger of losing the audience, too.</p>, <p>This will be remembered as the month when Turkey's elected regime crossed the moral red line into acts of genuine totalitarianism. It is a moment to back away from our close alliance with that regime.</p><p>Canada and its allies are relying on Turkey. Our military campaign in northern Iraq and Syria, to which Ottawa is contributing more than 800 trainers and special forces, would not function without the active co-operation, including access to military bases and border openings, provided by Turkey, a long-time fellow NATO member. And Turkey, which has received and is housing close to three million Syrian refugees, is seen as being vital in preventing the refugee flood into Europe from becoming less manageable - so vital that the European Union this week struck a deal in which the Turks, in exchange for reducing the refugee flow, will be given visa-free travel in Europe, billions in financing and a more direct pathway toward eventual EU membership.</p><p>Turkey, however, has become a problem. A really big problem. A week ago Friday, Turkish soldiers and police surrounded the offices of Zaman, the country's largest and by some measures best newspaper, fired tear gas, broke down the doors and seized control of the paper and its media empire with authorization from courts appointed by president Recep Tayyip Erdogan and his party. By Sunday morning, the paper, known for its independent-minded columnists, was publishing the most anodyne form of government propaganda.</p><p>This is bad enough in itself, but it is part of an unprecedented campaign to shut down or seize control of all forms of political, bureaucratic and media opposition - officially in the name of shutting down the Islamist and Kurdish movements. Mr. Erdogan claims they are security threats, but in practice, these crackdowns give him absolute executive power by eliminating all institutions of democratic and popular dissent.</p><p>That campaign went into high gear hours late last year after Mr. Erdogan's AKP (Justice and Development Party) won a majority in the Nov. 1 national election. The editors of the important moderate news magazine Nokta were imprisoned for 'fomenting armed rebellion' - that is, for criticizing Mr. Erdogan's authoritarian approach. The most outspoken columnists in the newspaper Milliyet were fired or silenced. TV stations have been shut down.</p><p>More than 1,800 people have been arrested in the past year on charges of 'insulting the president' - a law whose very existence is contradictory to democracy. Those imprisoned under it include the editor of the newspaper Birgun, who was found guilty of insulting Mr. Erdogan in an acrostic puzzle. And hundreds of government officials have been arrested or sacked on accusations that they are associated with the Islamist Gulen movement, which had brought Mr. Erdogan to power a decade and a half ago, but which he now opposes as a threat to his power.</p><p>Mr. Erdogan won November's election on a fear campaign aimed at Turkey's Kurds, who make up about a fifth of the country's population. The Kurdish-Turkish violence that drove those fears is entirely the creation of Mr. Erdogan, who abandoned his long and successful unity-building efforts in 2013 after Kurdish-led moderate political parties became popular with non-Kurdish Turks seeking a modern and European-minded alternative. They therefore became threats to his goal of gaining an absolute majority he could use to rewrite the Turkish constitution and make himself president for life.</p><p>Mr. Erdogan is now bombing his own citizens aggressively: The Kurdish-majority city of Diyarbakir has become a deadly place of bomb craters, house-to-house searches and seizures and late-night disappearances. Little of it has anything to do with actual threats to the Turkish state. As the British writer Christopher de Bellaigue recently observed of the Nov. 1 election: 'Erdogan pulled off the classic politician's trick of successfully selling the panacea for an ailment largely of his own making.'</p><p>Kurds in Syria and Iraq are our most important allies in Syria's civil war, and are key to finding a peaceful settlement to that conflict. By turning them into enemies strictly because they threatened his own grandiose political ambitions, Mr. Erdogan has destroyed the unified and open Turkey he earlier helped to create. And he has done so using the tools not just of authoritarianism but now, by silencing the media, of totalitarianism. It is time to stop treating Turkey as an ally, but as a country that has stepped beyond the pale.</p>, <p>In 2007, a constable with the Durham Regional Police was convicted of assaulting a female prisoner. He was suspended and demoted under the Ontario Police Services Act, but eventually returned to work. In 2011, during a routine traffic stop, he slammed a man's head into the roof of a car, struck the man repeatedly and pepper-sprayed him. Again, he was suspended and demoted.</p><p>During his second demotion, he started a foot chase with a man suffering from schizophrenia who had wandered into traffic. The scared man ran into his nearby home. The officer drew his gun, kicked in the front door, knocked the man to the floor and handcuffed him. He ignored the man's mother as she desperately tried to explain that her son was mentally ill. And then for good measure, after the man had been returned to his feet, the officer threw him to the ground again.</p><p>This time, finally, the officer was dismissed from the force.</p><p>What in God's name does it take to fire a bad cop in this country? That question arose again last week when a Vancouver police officer was convicted of assaulting a cyclist in an incident that was caught on video. In spite of his conviction, Constable Ismail Bhabha remains on patrol pending sentencing in the fall.</p><p>The video is incontrovertible. Constable Bhabha stopped Andishae Akhavan-Kharazi in March 2013 for allegedly running a red light on his bike and failing to wear a helmet. The police alleged Mr. Kharazi was unco-operative and that he needed to be detained. The video, shot by a friend of Mr. Kharazi, starts as Constable Bhabha and another officer are handcuffing their prisoner. He is passive but asking why he is being arrested. As his arms are being twisted behind him, he reflexively pulls one of them away and drops it to his side. It's nothing threatening.</p><p>And yet Constable Bhabha winds up and punches his subdued prisoner in the mouth. It's a vicious blow. You can hear the thwack.</p><p>So why is he still on the Vancouver force? Constable Bhabha has demonstrated he isn't up to the job. In the video, he abuses his authority and allows himself to over-react to the slightest of provocation. He is supposed to be the trained professional who keeps his head, but it is his hapless civilian prisoner who rises to the occasion and demonstrates the self-composure required for the job of being a police officer.</p><p>It is, in fact, very difficult to fire a police officer in Canada. Under the Ontario Police Services Act, officers charged with a criminal offence can be suspended with pay; one who is convicted can be suspended without pay. But moving from there to termination is long and onerous - so onerous, in fact, that Alok Mukherjee, the Toronto Police Services Board chair who resigned in June, once wondered if it is even realistically possible.</p><p>'Right now it is very, very hard to terminate a police officer,' Mr. Mukherjee said in 2013 after a Toronto officer gunned down a mentally unstable man on a streetcar (the officer, James Forcillo, has been charged with second-degree murder and is back at work while awaiting trial this fall). 'There are occasions where you say, 'How in God's name is this person still working here?''</p><p>British Columbia has a similarly complicated termination process under its provincial Police Act. When an officer is found to have breached the act's code of conduct, a police force has to option to fire, suspend, demote or reprimand. But the act requires the police force to choose the punishment that will be the least onerous for the officer, and to focus more on remediation than punishment.</p><p>Last week, Vancouver's chief of police, Adam Palmer, defended the decision to keep Constable Bhabha on patrol. 'He's a good police officer and he's highly regarded by his co-workers and a decorated officer,' he said. 'People may make a mistake on a certain day, but I don't think they should be judged for their entire career on just one thing.'</p><p>No one argues with that. But it depends on what that one thing is. In 2008, an off-duty Ottawa officer who had been fired for shoplifting was reinstated by the Ontario Civilian Police Commission. An isolated instance of shoplifting is a forgivable lapse in judgment that didn't bring the Ottawa Police Service into any particular disrepute or harm a civilian.</p><p>Being convicted of an unprovoked assault that is captured on video is a different matter. The only thing standing between a rogue officer and his or her well-deserved termination is provincial legislation that usurps common sense.</p><p>Legislation can be changed, though. And it should be, because times have changed. We are now in the era of the citizen video, an era that has irrevocably demonstrated to the public that there are officers out there who are not up to the job, and who put civilians at risk.</p><p>This minority of officers should not be protected by outdated provincial police acts anymore. For the good of all, let's make it easier to fire those who forfeit their right to serve and protect.</p>, <p>Because Conrad Black's interview with Toronto Mayor Rob Ford has vanished from Vision TV's website, and was taken off YouTube, I feel a duty to paint a picture for those who missed it. So get a mug of hot cocoa or a glass of mulled cider, and come and sit by the fire.</p><p>The interview was broadcast Monday night on a program called The Zoomer - a 'zoomer' is a 'boomer with zip' and ... oh dear, now you've spat up mulled cider on me, but never mind, my darlings, I understand.</p><p>The show was scored with swelling, canned, classical music and featured a kindly, elderly Conrad Black sitting with an affectedly 'chastened' Rob Ford, to whom he offered guidance. I'd have had wardrobe put Mr. Ford in a nightshirt and cap, but it was hardly needed: To watch Mr. Black interview the mayor was like watching the world's worst Christmas special.</p><p>In the years to come, when people tell tales of this interview, some will say that stories of just how seemingly sycophantic Mr. Black was have been exaggerated, so I'll say now that his interview made the queries of a good mall Santa to a child seated on his knee look like Frost/Nixon.</p><p>Mr. Black has since defended himself to Carol Off on the CBC's As it Happens, saying, 'They are not really interviews. They are conversations.'</p><p>I will accept 'fireside chats,' as done for Tiger Beat magazine, because when an interviewer begins a sentence with, 'If you don't mind me saying so and I'd think you'd say so yourself,' I can almost see flowers in the guest's dressing room. They are the garlands on the grave of actual journalism, something Mr. Black used to know about.</p><p>And, naturally, a beaming Rob Ford didn't mind one bit, and how could he? Mr. Black essentially played the Ghost of 'Hey, Christmas Presents!' by serving up questions as sweet as treacle tart, and frequently leaping in at the end with the answers, like dollops of clotted cream.</p><p>It was as though he was concerned Mr. Ford might be stumped by questions such as what the most 'offensive events - abrasions - that have been perpetrated on you or your family by the media' might be, and the like.</p><p>Mr. Ford had no problem at all with this one, claiming the most offensive perpetration award would go to Daniel Dale, a fine reporter with The Toronto Star, who in May, 2012, went to view some public land behind the mayor's house that Mr. Ford was, in an unusual move, attempting to buy from the city. He has said repeatedly that Mr. Dale stood on cinder blocks, peered over his fence and took pictures of his house, in the near dark.</p><p>None of these allegations - they've been investigated by the police, Mr. Ford has yet to produce the surveillance tape of this 'intrusion,' although tellingly the police have seen it, and it wasn't dark at the time (the diligent spring sun itself may be consulting a libel lawyer) - proved to be true. But this time another one was made. Mr. Dale, the mayor told a credulous Mr. Black, was 'in my backyard taking pictures. I have little kids. When a guy's taking pictures of little kids - I don't want to say that word, but you start thinking, 'What's this guy all about?' '</p><p>Now, the list of people Mr. Black has sued for libel merits its own Wiki - he has an ear for libel the way some people have an ear for music. I imagine that knowing waiters take his breakfast order and go with 'will allegedly have an egg-white omelette' when they reach the kitchen, and only then if they have three sources lined up back at the table.</p><p>So, it's curious that he didn't bat an eyelash when someone right in front of him claimed that a journalist standing on public land (this is very much on the record) was instead in the mayor's yard and taking pictures of children - children the mayor has said previously were inside. (Mr. Dale certainly feels the mayor was insinuating that he is a pedophile and has served notice that he will sue if Mr. Ford doesn't apologize in a hurry.)</p><p>Although not as curious as how complacent Mr. Black was at another of Mr. Ford's allegations: that Police Chief Bill Blair has investigated drug dealing, extortion and murder in Toronto (in other words done his job) only because the mayor asked him to make 'efficiencies.'</p><p>But I will leave that tale for the Ghost-of-Christmas-Yet-To-Oh-Come-On! As it is, the tape of the Zoomer broadcast has vanished, which tapes can do in this town. Was his unfortunate interview with the mayor Conrad Black's crack video?</p>, <p>If even a fraction of the darkness that his haters say has descended upon Canada under Stephen Harper was real, then the opening line of any election victory speech by Thomas Mulcair or Justin Trudeau could only be: 'My fellow Canadians, our long national nightmare is over.'</p><p>In less than a decade, during most of which Mr. Harper led a minority government, Canada has gone from a 'haven' of enlightened liberalism and goodness to a hermit kingdom run by a small-minded tyrant propagating, in the words of one excitable critic, 'know-nothing conservatism.'</p><p>Just what it is about the Conservative Leader that sends reasonable people into such fits of hysteria is best examined by historians, or better yet, psychiatrists. But it surely can't be evidence, for Mr. Harper's political style is not particularly novel, nor have his reforms been that transformational.</p><p>Rather, Mr. Harper cultivates his base with mostly rhetorical, and only occasionally policy-driven, validations of their beliefs and value systems. It's largely window dressing. For the most part, he governs from the centre, upholding the long Canadian tradition of middle-of-the-road pragmatism. So much so that movement conservatives who once considered him one of them feel utterly betrayed.</p><p>If the Harper government seems more obsessed with spin than its predecessors, it's partly because the science of political message control and targeting has undergone a revolution in the Internet-Big Data age. Mr. Harper's government, like President Barack Obama's administration south of the border, has simply been in the right place at the right time to make the most of it.</p><p>Yes, the Conservatives have made some questionable policy choices in the name of stroking their base. Killing the long-form census was one. The form had been a long-standing bugaboo among conservatives who felt the state has no business knowing the granular details of their lives. Its demise has inconvenienced some researchers, but it has hardly led to a 'subtle darkening of Canadian life.' Somehow when it comes to critiquing Mr. Harper, all perspective gets thrown out the window.</p><p>Nothing infuriates the critics more - and this is where their slip shows - than his success at usurping the political tools their side once used to corner the market. He's turned the Liberals' invention of multiculturalism against them. He's wooed suburban couples with kids away from the Liberals with an array of dubiously useful family-friendly tax credits.</p><p>The truth is, Mr. Harper does not play to his base any more than the NDP's Mr. Mulcair or the Liberals' Mr. Trudeau play to theirs. But because elites in the media and academe have deemed Conservative supporters a less evolved species than the progressive subclass to which they themselves belong, they are beside themselves at the loss of their own influence.</p><p>Autocratic, Stephen Harper? Well, yes, like just about every other successful prime minister from John A. Macdonald to Mackenzie King to Jean Chretien. The centralization of decision making in the Prime Minister's Office is a phenomenon much bigger than Mr. Harper and it would take wholesale parliamentary, if not constitutional, reform to reverse the trend.</p><p>What's fairly clear is that a Mulcair PMO would not be expected to operate in a meaningfully different manner. The NDP Leader is as much a control freak and ruthless enforcer of caucus discipline. How else do you think he has kept his neophyte MPs in Quebec from embarrassing him too much? The worry with Mr. Trudeau is that his lack of experience would allow unelected political aides or bureaucrats to wield most of the power in a Trudeau PMO. But that doesn't mean the PMO would be any less dominant in a Trudeau government.</p><p>Mr. Harper may deserve to take a hit for the Senate expense scandal. The questions raised at Senator Mike Duffy's fraud trial about the conduct of Mr. Harper's closest staff in the PMO, and the Conservative Leader himself, are not flattering. But in the annals of Canadian political scandals - a fairly tame volume to begin with - this is a footnote.</p><p>Most voters basically believe all politicians are self-interested maximizers and judge them on their intelligence, competence, likeability and integrity. They know they can't get everything on their wish list. It could be that, after 10 years, they'll decide they've had enough of Mr. Harper.</p><p>And the hysterics won't have Harper to kick around any more.</p>, <p>When I was a kid, the milkman came right to our back door. He brought us bright glass bottles of rich whole milk and thick sweet cream. We drank a lot of milk. Nobody had heard of skim. On weekends my dad cooked up breakfasts of eggs fried in butter, piles of bacon, delicious German sausages. For dinner, we had big chunks of fatty meat every night.</p><p>That was in the 1950s. Nobody was fat, except for one lone girl at school who everybody picked on. Most kids ate like horses and were skinny as rakes.</p><p>Then the experts came along and declared that all that fat was killing us. Whole milk was banished from children's diets so that they would not develop clogged arteries and heart disease in later life. To keep our cholesterol in check, we began to ration eggs and treat butter like a toxic substance. We gave up our juicy, marbled steaks and switched to pasta. Ever since the 1960s, the authorities have told us that a healthy diet is a low-fat diet.</p><p>The results were not what they had hoped. Obesity rates soared, but heart disease did not subside. And now, a mountain of new evidence says the experts were all wrong. One Harvard study found that people who had consumed the most dairy fat were far less likely to develop heart disease. Researchers at Oxford University discovered that the biggest consumers of saturated fat in Europe - the French - also have the healthiest hearts. Last year, a major review in The BMJ, a leading medical journal, found that 'saturated fats are not associated' with mortality, heart disease, strokes or Type 2 diabetes. As Ian Leslie, writing in The Guardian, puts it, 'The promotion of low-fat diets was a 40-year fad, with disastrous outcomes, conceived of, authorized, and policed by nutritionists.'</p><p>The modern history of nutrition science is fraught with controversy, flawed theory, faulty research, vested interests, suppression of evidence, and vicious battles between the old guard and the insurgents. They're still fighting. But it's clear that a lot of what your Food Guide says is flat-out wrong.</p><p>The biggest villain of modern diets isn't fat. It's sugar and carbohydrates.</p><p>As far back as 1972, a mild-mannered British nutrition scientist named John Yudkin challenged the conventional wisdom, arguing that sugar, not dietary fat, was what was making people fat and sick. His reasoning was in part grounded in history: Humans have been carnivores forever, but carbohydrates, and especially sugar, are very recent additions to the human diet.</p><p>The Yudkin theory made sense, and is undergoing a revival. But in the meantime, as Mr. Leslie writes, he and his work were brutally suppressed. By then the North American dietary establishment was firmly in the grip of the fat hypothesis, which had been developed by a forceful and ambitious American nutritionist named Ancel Keys. He had all the institutional power, and he used it to trash his rivals.</p><p>Dr. Keys, who died in 2004, also seems to have suppressed inconvenient evidence. In the late 1960s and early seventies, he and a research team conducted a massive investigation into the effects of diet on thousands of mental patients. One group was fed a 'heart healthy' diet low in saturated fats; the other ate a more typical American diet. The special diet did indeed reduce blood cholesterol, what the researchers called a 'favourable trend.' But the published results were incomplete. The full results were published for the first time last week in the BMJ, they tell quite a different story. Patients on the special diet, especially those over 64, had a higher mortality rate than those on the regular diet.</p><p>The Keys theory is on the way to being thoroughly debunked, not least because of the investigative work of journalist Nina Teicholz (author of The Big Fat Surprise, who is persona non grata among the nutrition establishment). Yet the establishment is still deeply embedded in the status quo. Reputations and careers are at stake; plenty of leading doctors have diet empires of their own.</p><p>What's so devastating about this story, as Mr. Leslie points out, is the answer it supplies to one simple question: Who made us fat? And no, it wasn't the usual villains - big-food interests, the sugar lobby - although they certainly played a role. It was the scientific authorities and the governments that believed them.</p><p>So Vive la France, and pass the butter. There's no time to waste.</p>, <p>There are many aspects to the current struggle over the future of Crimea which pose serious difficulties for an international community that would like to respond firmly. On the one hand, Vladimir Putin's charade over troops without insignia notwithstanding, this is an act of naked aggression against a sovereign state. On the other, the realistic options for forceful responses in the short term look pretty limited.</p><p>But there are signs that some European leaders, who must rise to the fore if there is to be a significant non-military response, may be serious about imposing further sanctions. The initial round of sanctions against individuals could be a prelude. Serious sanctions could hurt Russia's surprisingly vulnerable economy, if really pushed hard.</p><p>Notably, German Chancellor Angela Merkel has made some tough statements about pain to come, even though it might also hurt German businesses. Ms. Merkel, who grew up in the former East Germany and speaks fluent Russian, has spoken sharply to Mr. Putin about the crisis, and, presumably, harbours few illusions about what it is like to live in a vassal state occupied by Russian troops.</p><p>If the previous history of talking big but often backing down is any guide, it is easy to say that Europe's leaders will lack the determination to see it through. Perhaps that will happen this time as well. However, there is an element to this crisis which makes it just possible that Europe's leaders will be prepared to accept pain in order to inflict some of it on Mr. Putin and his Russian political allies.</p><p>It's about the question of European borders.</p><p>One of the central elements of the post-1945 European security system that all players have accepted is that borders are sacrosanct; even ones that make little sense in ethnic or historical terms. Having endured centuries of wars, culminating in the carnage of the First and Second World Wars, a tacit agreement took hold post-1945 that borders have to be left alone, even if there are ethnic minorities in another country.</p><p>This didn't happen right away, of course, but by the 1970s the idea was enshrined in various European security and co-operation documents that the post-1945 borders of the continent had to be respected, even the ones that made no sense. If ever changes were to be made, they had to be made through diplomacy only. The alternative was a return to the kind of Europe we saw pre-1945 - and no one wanted that.</p><p>It was the Russians themselves who were amongst the most keen to enshrine this principle in European security affairs. Former Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev regarded it as one of his great accomplishments that the West had accepted the post-1945 borders. He was, in return, willing to sign on to various human rights provisions. (He had no intention of fulfilling these, of course, but they ultimately helped foster a network of dissidents across the former Eastern Bloc which were instrumental in bringing it down. But that's another story.)</p><p>In his move into Crimea, Mr. Putin has thus directly challenged a fundamental principle which is at the very heart of the European system; you don't carve up states to satisfy the desire to reunite ethnic groups or re-establish empires. There are lots of ethnic minorities which are on one side or the other of a border that was arbitrarily decided by where various armies had got to in the spring of 1945. Are we to go back to a European system whereby states engage in military adventurism to rectify these anomalies in their favour?</p><p>It may take a while for Europe's leaders, and their North American allies to respond, as it did when Slobodan Milosevic did the same in the Balkans (and the response certainly won't be military, as Russia is a different order of adversary than Serbia was), but to accept what Mr. Putin is doing with nothing more than a shrug opens the door to a return to a kind of European order that is simply not tenable.</p><p>Perhaps Mr. Putin will get away with it. At the least, if he accepts diplomacy and compromise, he is likely to get guarantees that Ukraine won't join NATO, and some sort of ongoing say in the governance of a permanently neutral country - which may have been his biggest objectives all along.</p><p>But, if Mr. Putin doesn't take one of the diplomatic off-ramps being laid for him as a way out of this crisis, he may be in for a surprise at just how harsh the response could be; a newly reinvigorated NATO, and ongoing sanctions. Neither would be in Russia's longer-term interests.</p><p>Mr. Putin cannot be forced out of Crimea if he decides to stay. But the cost of this adventure can be made to hurt as a signal that it is a way of doing business that is not pain-free.</p><p>Peter Jones is an associate professor in the Graduate School of Public and International Affairs at the University of Ottawa and an Annenberg Distinguished Visited Fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University.</p>, <p>Two trends have snuck up on us - slower long-term economic growth and an aging society. Together, they will stress public finances and force harder decisions for governments, regardless of political stripe. They will put squarely before society the options of higher taxes and/or fewer government services, options no politician or electorate welcomes.</p><p>This week, the Bank of Canada published economic growth estimates. The bank said economic growth in 2012, when all is accounted for, will be 1.9 per cent, followed by 2 per cent in 2013 and 2.7 per cent in 2014. If correct (and predictions are usually proven at least slightly wrong), that would mean an average growth rate of 2.2 per cent over these three years.</p><p>Look back over the 19 years leading to 2011. According to the World Bank's numbers, Canada's economy grew at more than 2.2 per cent in 13 of those years, grew at less five of those years, and at the 2.2 per cent rate once. On average, the Canadian economy grew closer to 3 per cent than 2 per cent over that period of almost two decades.</p><p>Per year, the difference between 2 and 3 per cent growth doesn't seem like much. Add it up, year after year, and the gap is telling. More important, most of the long-term forecasting suggests that for the rest of this decade, growth will be slower than what we knew before the financial recession of 2008.</p><p>The effects of slower growth will be twofold. First, government revenues will grow less rapidly than before, assuming no changes in tax rates. Second, some government expenditures will increase with slower growth, especially since slower growth means stubbornly high unemployment. The double-whammy will pinch government budgets, which are already strained by deficits, except in Saskatchewan.</p><p>Then, there is the aging population with fewer people in the work force to earn income for governments to tax to produce revenues for the additional costs of an aging society. The baby-boomer generation began to retire two years ago, the harbinger of what will be a lopsided population profile.</p><p>Today, about 14 per cent of the population is over 65 years of age. It is estimated that in two decades, almost 25 per cent will be seniors. The ratio of those working to those out of the work force will change slowly but dramatically over time.</p><p>Unless Canadians work much smarter and unless the Canadian economy becomes much more productive - both of which require, at a minimum, more investments in education and research (and reducing poverty, which is a drag on economic performance) - then aging will be a long-term drag on growth.</p><p>Health-care spending for seniors, for example, will rise because there will be more of them. The best estimates suggest only an increase of 1 per cent in overall health-care spending, but that would be something of the order of $1.4-billion per year in today's dollars. Any ideas where that money might be found? Higher taxes? Reductions in spending elsewhere? Both.</p><p>The extra spending is only one part of the equation. The other part is that fewer people will be in the work force to tax to pay for the higher costs. Call it an unfunded future liability.</p><p>Political people are elected for four years. These trends, however, stretch far beyond one term in office. Finding political people who will explain these trends, and finding voters willing to listen to complicated explanations in a dumbed-down media world, will be supremely challenging.</p><p>Maybe the long-term growth projections are too pessimistic. Maybe startling technological breakthroughs will transform economic life. Maybe governments can reinvent how they deliver services, so that Baumol's cost disease - that public-sector wage gains outstrip productivity over time - will be proven wrong.</p><p>Maybe Canadians can be persuaded that they should pay a larger share of their incomes in taxes, and stop dreaming that hard decisions can be avoided by the magic potion of 'efficiency gains.' Maybe the United States, on whose economic strength Canada depends, will recover its esprit.</p><p>But for now, it would appear that the already hard challenges of governing will become even harder in an age of constrained resources.</p>, <p>Here's a slogan on sale for last-minute political shoppers: Canadian energy for Canadians!</p><p>How radical would that be? Here we are in a country pleased (wrongly) to call itself an 'energy superpower,' but the best our governments and energy companies can usually manage are new ways to export energy.</p><p>Yes, yes, Canada has energy surpluses. And these surpluses need to find markets elsewhere to be profitable, whether it's hydro or oil or natural gas. We can't use all we produce. We can make money sending it south or overseas. But we could use more if we thought of energy as a national asset for use first by Canadians, or at least more by Canadians.</p><p>Canada's constitutional arrangements get in the way of thinking nationally. The provinces control natural resources here, unlike in other federations. Provinces think first and foremost of themselves, in particular how much money they can get for those resources, which invariably means selling them outside Canada.</p><p>Ottawa generally stands mute on the sidelines. This silence has been particularly apparently during the Harper years, because the Conservative government applies strict constitutional reasoning: What is federal is federal, what is provincial is provincial. You can see this at work in health care. Ottawa will cut a cheque, but not attach strings to how the money is spent.</p><p>This strict compartmentalization is a defensible constitutional position. It minimizes squabbling. It keeps Ottawa out of the provinces' hair. It cuts down on costly, sometimes open-ended federal interventions in areas of provincial jurisdiction. It prevents Ottawa from being seen by provinces as nothing more than a cash cow.</p><p>But another way of thinking about Canadian federalism sees Ottawa with its 'spending power,' a power upheld by the courts, and the only government with a 'national' vision.</p><p>Natural resources such as energy are provincially owned with national implications. Where we sell, to whom and for what prices, and how we exploit the resources have fiscal-policy and sometimes foreign-policy implications. Natural resources contribute to the country's standard of living, and to regional differences, which Ottawa through equalization is charged with trying to flatten.</p><p>A 'Canadian energy for Canadians' approach would not see Uncle Ottawa bullying its way into provincial jurisdiction. Rather, it would invite the federal government to suggest to provinces that it stands ready to assist them financially in projects that would move Canadian energy across the country.</p><p>Think about hydroelectricity. We don't have anything like a national grid in Canada. We don't even have effective regional grids, but rather bits and pieces of regional grids. We've got highways and train tracks linking the heartlands of Quebec and Ontario, but we don't have an energy corridor from surplus-producing Quebec to Ontario.</p><p>By extension, we don't have the capacity (or political willingness) to move Newfoundland's future hydro surpluses to Ontario. Instead, if the next Labrador projects ever see the light of day, the power will go through the Maritimes to the United States, aided by a loan guarantee from Ottawa.</p><p>The same applies for Manitoba hydro surpluses that Ontario says it does not want or need, so the surplus goes south. In the West, new surpluses of oil and gas have gone south or offshore.</p><p>Three or four years ago, a group of people from environmental and business organizations, and from assorted think tanks, gathered in Winnipeg and Banff to talk about what a more national energy framework might look like. More than anything else, it was a mind-stretching exercise trying to think through how future energy and environmental policies might work together across the country.</p><p>They deliberately didn't invite the federal government, because they understood such talk would offend the Conservatives. They were even reluctant in the early stages to invite provincial representatives, in case anybody believed - perish the thought - the wind was up for something called a National Energy Policy.</p><p>Preliminary papers were produced and much private discussion ensued, but the effort petered out.</p><p>We are left therefore with a funny country: very rich in energy of every kind but unable and unwilling to talk about it in a national context. The best and often only approach we can take is to frame discussions about how fast, and under what circumstances, we can produce it to send elsewhere.</p>, <p>Sometimes a guy can't catch a break.</p><p>'Justin. Unplugged.' read the eye-catching invitation to a Toronto fundraiser held last week. The come-on offered well-heeled professional ladies (their word, not mine) the chance to hear the 'future prime minister of Canada' address such hardball questions as, 'What's your favourite virtue?' and 'Who are your real-life heroes?'</p><p>Ladies, sometimes I cringe for my sex.</p><p>'To be honest, when I first saw the invite - complete with Warholian photos of Justin - I thought it was an attack ad, thought up by the Conservative Party's war room,' blogged government-relations expert Lisa Kirbie. And she's a liberal.</p><p>It went downhill from there. During the event, Mr. Trudeau was asked which nation's administration, besides Canada's, he admires most. 'Not the fluffy questions some were expecting!' exclaimed Amanda Alvaro, the host. Justin's response to this brain-buster showed why he can't be trusted to go around unplugged.</p><p>'You know, there's a level of admiration I actually have for China,' he said. He went on to observe that dictatorships are able to do things faster than democracies, like going green and investing in solar panels. Sensing that he was neck-deep in the swamp, he tried to recover, but it was too late. Everybody pounced on him - Conservatives, New Democrats, Tibetans. Right-wing pundits posted photos of smog-choked Chinese cities, where people die of air pollution by the thousands. An Asian-Canadian coalition formed to fight Chinese oppression held a press conference that was covered by the CBC. They demanded an apology and a meeting to describe their personal experiences of persecution. 'Can I use the word 'foolish'?' said one.</p><p>In the big scheme of things, this is a nothing. But it's trouble Mr. Trudeau doesn't need. It reinforces the impression that he's the guy in short pants. He's supposed to be the master of social media, but thanks to ladies' night, he's been trending on Twitter for all the wrong reasons.</p><p>Anyone who watched Question Period during the Senate scandals could see that Mr. Trudeau was totally outclassed. As the NDP's Thomas Mulcair dissected Stephen Harper's changing version of events with surgical precision, Mr. Trudeau came across as an earnest amateur. When debate time comes around again, those two will carve him up. Poor Liberals. They have the wrong leader.</p><p>As Mr. Trudeau spent all weekend gamely tweeting to defend himself, Mr. Harper stroked some of the ethnic groups his party has courted with such success. He showed up in Toronto to celebrate Diwali, where he declared that India is at the centre of the government's Asian policy. He spoke at the Ukrainian Canadian Congress convention, where he got five standing ovations.</p><p>Perhaps wisely, Mr. Trudeau has mostly stayed away from boring policy stuff. After all, his strongest asset is supposed to be his personality, and the next election is far away. Still, I am beginning to suspect his policy needs work too. A couple of weeks ago, he said he thinks Canada should put a price on carbon - even though the main (and only) effect would be to raise prices for consumers while making Canadian industry less competitive. Mr. Harper, meanwhile, is going to campaign on unbundling your cable fees. If Mr. Trudeau plans to fight for the middle class, maybe he should think up something else.</p><p>As Ms. Kirbie blogged the other day, Justin's biggest political problem is that he looks vapid and lightweight. The trouble is, whenever he takes a stab at saying something really substantive, he winds up looking ... vapid and lightweight.</p><p>That's a problem. Even when he's only talking to the ladies.</p>, <p>Whether the irony of the change will dawn on Canadians before the October election cannot yet be known, but ideas that inspire the Harper government's 'tough on crime' agenda are now under assault in the country that spawned them, the United States.</p><p>Across the U.S. political spectrum, from liberal Democrats to conservative Republicans, the kinds of policies adopted by the Harper government are being questioned or abandoned, including by some who used to favour them.</p><p>Many U.S. news media reports have remarked on the change, which is particularly notable among Republican candidates for their party's presidential nomination. Not long ago, most Republicans were all for locking criminals up and throwing away the key, both literally and figuratively.</p><p>No longer. Very right-wing candidates such as senators Rand Paul and Ted Cruz favour limiting mandatory minimum sentences, which the Harper government has introduced for certain offences only to see them struck down in Canadian courts.</p><p>Other candidates are seeking alternatives to incarceration, preferring treatment to prison for those convicted of drug offences. The presumptive front-runner for the nomination, former Florida governor Jeb Bush, has signed on to a conservative group's call for cost-effective alternatives to prison. Former Texas Republican governor Rick Perry, another candidate, was quoted in The New York Times saying, 'A big, expensive system - one that offers no hope for second chances - is not conservative policy. Conservative policy is smart on crime.'</p><p>No hope, or diminished hope, for second chances is a cornerstone for the Harper government, which has made keeping offenders longer in jail a hallmark of its 'tough on crime' policy.</p><p>In recent months, it tried to pass legislation eliminating the possibility of parole for first-degree murder. Another change made criminals wait for five years to reapply instead of two if their initial request for parole was denied.</p><p>Canadian courts have been paring back some Conservative initiatives, but that does not stop the Tories from dreaming up more restrictions for prisoners and harsher sentences rather than rehabilitation.</p><p>Recently, the Auditor-General of Canada showed how counter-productive this approach can be. The A-G studied the government's abolition of accelerated parole review, a form of supervised early release for non-violent first-time offenders.</p><p>These offenders now must wait longer before being released into the community under supervision. The results have been exactly the reverse of what the Conservatives predicted.</p><p>The Conservatives claimed the change would make the community safer. Counters the Auditor-General: 'Data consistently shows that low-risk offenders who serve longer portions of their sentence in the community have more positive reintegration results.' The A-G also noted: 'It is three times more costly to hold an offender in custody than to supervise him in the community.'</p><p>On both counts - reintegration and cost - the Harper government approach is a flop. But rhetorically, the idea of keeping people in prison for as long as possible, even if the results are perverse, resonates with those who believe in it.</p><p>In the United States, 'tough on crime' measures of the past four decades swelled the prison population by a factor of seven. Prisons are crowded and costly. The same trends are in the early stages in Canada. As the Auditor-General noted, crime is down, but the male prison population is up, largely because offenders are serving more of their sentences in custody.</p><p>Burgeoning costs in the United States - a country with a huge prison population - is one of the reasons Republicans are having second thoughts about policies they once endorsed. Even the super-conservative Koch brothers' foundation reckons the criminal justice system is not working, for society or offenders.</p><p>The Harper government's 'tough on crime' policy always was more of a political slogan than anything. Almost every criminal law expert in Canada opposed the approach, for many of the reasons now being explored, albeit belatedly, by Republican voices in the United States.</p><p>Crime rates for almost all major offences had been declining for many years before the Harper government's election. Still, it suited the Conservative Party's purposes to deny facts and to sharpen its appeal to those who thought a crime wave was breaking over Canada.</p><p>The government scorned the federal Justice Department experts who knew the policies would fail. Instead, the Conservatives were inspired by what they thought worked politically in the United States.</p><p>It might now be appropriate for Canadians to ask: Why have we adopted an approach even U.S. conservatives acknowledge is not working?</p>, <p>It's tough to be a high-school principal today. That's because the inmates are running the asylum.</p><p>Last month Scot Bishop, the principal at Centennial Collegiate Vocational Institute in Guelph, Ont., decided to remind his students about appropriate clothing during warm weather. 'Dress cool, not skanky,' he advised them over the intercom. After that, all hell broke loose. Female students accused the principal of sexism and slut-shaming. 'The issue is not that students are wearing provocative clothing,' declared Brittany Harlick, who organized a protest. 'It's that young bodies are being sexualized and that's a felony.'</p><p>The school board had a word with Mr. Bishop, who issued an apology to all he had offended.</p><p>Dress codes have relaxed a bit in recent decades. Today, ripped jeans, saggy jeans, exposed bra straps, ragged short-shorts, and tights (sans skirts) are almost de rigueur. About all that's required is that the kids' clothes cover their underwear. Some things never change, though. As always, the adults' job is to set reasonable boundaries on decorum, and the students' job is to subvert them.</p><p>Ever since the '60s (and no doubt long before), students have complained that school dress codes are arbitrary, demeaning, antiquated, and an outrageous violation of their freedom of expression. But now they have another weapon in their fight against adult oppression. School dress codes reinforce rape culture.</p><p>'Dress codes lead to the sexualization of young women, the punishing of women for taking control of their own bodies and the blaming/shaming of women who don't dress overly-modest,' asserted a petition to the Fredericton school board, which had a heated dress-code protest last fall. 'Blaming women for the clothes they wear rather than blaming men for sexualizing women is also a big contributor to rape culture.'</p><p>In other words, if a female student comes to school dressed like a street person/hooker/skank, it's your problem. Somewhere, perhaps, there is a line. But the authorities are not entitled to draw it.</p><p>Last month, graduating seniors at Biglerville High School in Pennsylvania got some tips from the administration about how to dress for the awards ceremony. 'Gentlemen,' said the letter. 'PULL YOUR PANTS UP! Your underwear choices should be your own private choice and remain private.' As for the girls, it counselled, 'No bellies showing ... Please remember as you select an outfit for the awards assembly that we don't want to be looking at 'sausage rolls' as Mrs. Elliott calls them. As you get dressed remember that you can't put 10 pounds of mud in a five-pound sack.'</p><p>This frank if tactless advice was greeted by torrents of outrage from critics, who called it sexist and degrading. One offended mother threatened to sue for sexual harassment. The school board quickly grovelled.</p><p>Girls, of course, should not be blamed if guys leer at/hit on/get distracted by them. Guys must learn that girls deserve respect no matter how they dress. But there's something disingenuous in this debate. It is a fiction that girls dress only to please themselves, for comfort. Every former teenage girl knows that most girls dress to attract guys. And every former teenage boy knows that most guys think horny thoughts around seven times a minute. That's not rape culture. That's biology.</p><p>Thanks to social media, girls in skimpy clothes are the new champions of women's rights. After the principal at Alexi Halket's Toronto school politely suggested that her crop top was inappropriate for the classroom, she took to social media and organized Crop Top Day, which went viral. 'School dress codes teach female students that their bodies are a problem and they have to cover up,' she told MTV. 'They should really be teaching acceptance and body positivity, and also human rights.'</p><p>Of course, as Ms. Halket will soon discover, feminist arguments for wearing crop tops don't cut much ice in the adult world of work. But for now, she and other youthful protesters can bask in fame. 'We are clearly in a moment of social action,' two Brock University professors, Shauna Pomerantz and Rebecca Raby, wrote in this newspaper last week. 'The activist fire seems to be spreading from school to school. What does this mean for youthful politics in Canada? And what does this mean for feminism - long considered dead among younger generations, which are often labelled apathetic?'</p><p>Personally, I think it means that high-school kids might all be better off in uniforms. Not that they won't find something else to protest about.</p>, <p>Ian Buruma is professor of democracy, human rights and journalism at Bard College, and the author of Year Zero: A History of 1945.</p><p>---------------------------------------</p><p>Much has been written about Donald Trump's peculiar hairstyle, the kind of puffy, dyed comb-over one would associate with a downmarket nightclub manager rather than a presidential candidate. Is there really any more to be said? Actually, the question of hair in politics might not be as trivial as it seems.</p><p>It is remarkable how many politicians, especially on the populist right, have sported heterodox hairdos. Silvio Berlusconi, Italy's former prime minister, used black pencil to fill in the patches not covered by his two hair transplants. The Dutch demagogue Geert Wilders dyes his Mozartian bouffant platinum blond. Boris Johnson, the Brexit rabble-rouser, now British foreign secretary, takes care to keep his straw-colored thatch in a permanent state of studied untidiness. All have scored highly with voters filled with anger and resentment about polished urban elites.</p><p>Then there was the father of modern European populism, the late Dutch politician Pim Fortuyn, who had no hair at all. But his shiny, clean-shaven pate stood out as much among the neat grey coiffures of mainstream politicians as does Mr. Johnson's blond mop and Mr. Trump's gilded affair.</p><p>Standing out is, of course, the point. The strange hair, or shaven head, makes the popular leader instantly recognizable. This type of branding is common among dictators. Hitler's visual image could be reduced to a greasy cowlick and a toothbrush mustache. The oddest-looking of all contemporary dictators must be North Korea's Kim Jong-un, whose clean-shaven back and sides are cultivated as a deliberate imitation of his grandfather's 1930s proletarian hairstyle.</p><p>But self-parody sometimes works in democracies, too. Winston Churchill, who in many ways is Mr. Johnson's model, always made sure to carry a big cigar, even when he had no intention of smoking it. There was not much he could do about his sparse hair, but he certainly dressed differently than anyone else. Studied nonchalance, or cultivated eccentricity, was a sign of the typical aristocrat who felt no need to conform to the boring standards of middle-class correctness.</p><p>The United States does not have a formal aristocracy; status is more a question of money. One of the secrets of Mr. Trump's popularity is that he flaunts his supposed great wealth. He even exaggerates it. The absurd golden chairs in his pastiche Louis XIV homes are a coarse imitation of aristocratic style. Mr. Fortuyn, on a more modest Dutch scale, and Mr. Berlusconi, on a more grandiose Italian stage, had similar tastes. People for whom this is the stuff of dreams admired them for it. Affirming the dreams of people who have little is the key to successful populism.</p><p>The main thing is that these politicians are not like the dull and moderate mainstream. Even insiders have to pose as outsiders, who can stand with the common man against the political establishment. Weirdness - peculiar upper-class mannerisms, ostentatious living, outrageous jokes, deliberate crassness and mad hairstyles - is an asset.</p><p>I am not sure people who rightly see Mr. Trump as a great danger to the U.S. and the world sufficiently appreciate this.</p><p>Much has been made of the reasonable and moderate tone of the Democratic National Convention, compared with the snarling bombast of the Republicans' event. President Barack Obama, Vice-president Joe Biden and nominee Hillary Clinton were paragons of dignity, compared with Mr. Trump's Mussolini-like mannerisms and verbal aggression.</p><p>Clinton supporters tend to attack Mr. Trump with ridicule, which can be an effective weapon. (In the 1920s, journalists such as H.L. Mencken made Christian fundamentalists in the U.S. look so foolish that they dropped out of politics for several generations.) And Mr. Trump's offensive braggadocio, his vulgar tastes and his extraordinary looks are all eminently ripe for satire. Comedians have had merciless fun at his expense. But satire and ridicule will not work to persuade people who love Mr. Trump precisely because of his weirdness. It sets him apart from the establishment they despise. Charisma does not call for restraint in words, appearance or manner. The weirder he gets, the more his supporters like him. And the more that clever comedians mock him, the more his fans will rally to his side.</p><p>This is the great perversity in our age of angry populism. Reasonable arguments and political optimism can now be turned into negative qualities, the typical marks of a complacent elite, oblivious to the concerns of people who feel that the joke has been on them. Reasonable argument did not work to convince 51.9 per cent of British voters to remain part of the European Union. It may not work to keep an ignorant and dangerous buffoon - silly hairstyle and all - from becoming president of the United States.</p><p>------------------------------------</p><p>Project Syndicate</p>, <p>Reasonable people can disagree over the size of the state. Whatever its size, we want the state to be effective.</p><p>Despite a lot of anti-government rhetoric, many government programs are efficient. Some, however, are not. Although readers will cast mental votes for their favourite offenders, a case can be made that the Canadian Air Transport Security Authority should be a contender for this list.</p><p>CATSA is really not to blame for what it inflicts on air passengers. CATSA enforces the rules established by Transport Canada - rules that cause long lineups that would make any time-and-motion expert weep. Those lineups, the agency's bureaucracy and the Transport Canada rules would bring a smile to Osama bin Laden's lips, for his memory lives on daily in air transportation.</p><p>The rules are based on a maximum risk assessment for every passenger, which is a recipe for inefficiency and, one supposes, safety from some lawsuit about 'profiling.'</p><p>This maximum risk assessment explains why elderly women in wheelchairs or shuffling with canes are searched. Even their wheelchairs get patted down for explosive material, if you can believe it. Children in strollers get the full monty.</p><p>People with artificial joints - generally older people - are particularly targeted. They always get the full monty, too. Speaking of those scanning machines, how to explain that the same pair of shoes will cause no trouble at one airport but set off alarms at another airport, on the same day?</p><p>By way of contrast, Australia sets the machines lower, which means that many people pass easily through them. Every eighth or 10th passenger does get swabbed. In Germany, home of brilliant engineering, conveyor belts take the trays from one end to the other, whereas in Canada, it is CATSA people who do this work.</p><p>Even people carrying NEXUS cards (for which they have paid and passed security tests) are searched. They can be asked to remove their shoes, enter scanning machines, get patted down.</p><p>Speaking of NEXUS, both the United States and Canada do security checks on the same people, instead of recognizing each other's clearance. This means that getting a card takes six months or more. Renewing the card can mean going through the entire screening again, although this is in the process of changing.</p><p>In the United States, those with the Global Entry card - the rough international equivalent to NEXUS - can now zoom through dedicated lines. Having already been certified as no threat to the state, the holder goes into a special line where no shoes and belts are removed, no laptops leave briefcases, no coats are taken off. Only cellphones are placed in the tray. The result is fast movement for thousands of travellers.</p><p>Transport Canada, however, subjects NEXUS cardholders to the same scrutiny as all other passengers. When CATSA officials are asked why Canada does things that even the security-obsessed Americans don't, the reply is usually a shrug or a comment that 'These are the rules.' So they are, even though they make no sense.</p><p>Someone who sits at cabinet meetings remarked that ministers often grouse about the Transport Canada/CATSA rules, because cabinet ministers fly a lot. But they do nothing, presumably because they fear that if anything bad ever happened on their watch, the government would be blamed. Canadians have apparently become so accustomed to the CATSA performance that they don't complain very much.</p><p>A favourite example of the disjunction between those ministers and the real world of CATSA occurred when then-transport minister Chuck Strahl announced a forthcoming easing of some security rules. It was great news, except that simultaneously, selected passengers were being put through a new procedure in which they had to turn over their palms for swab tests in case they had recently been manufacturing bombs.</p><p>The fixation with air security - even at the tertiary airports with small planes where CATSA officials dutifully carry out Transport Canada rules - represents bureaucratic overkill. Anybody who wanted to kill a lot of people could find targets with as many people as airplanes - trains, bus stations, stadiums, shopping malls.</p><p>We don't subject any of these gathering places to the level of security we reserve for airlines, because of the memory of what happened in New York on Sept. 11, 2001, and episodic threats elsewhere since.</p><p>We are trapped in the past, without sensible judgment or risk assessment, having built a large, new bureaucracy whose rules are designed to be as rigid as possible, thereby mocking the idea of the efficient state.</p>, <p>Mayor John Tory summed up the conundrum facing every city trying to deal with the Uber blitzkrieg when he announced on Monday that he plans to update Toronto's taxi bylaws.</p><p>'What we need is one bylaw that applies without question to everybody,' he said. 'We cannot have the Wild West, but we also cannot have a city that in some way ignores the march of technology and time.'</p><p>Exactly. It's unfair that taxi drivers who have paid for their expensive municipal permits and licences are now watching cities like Toronto do little or nothing while Uber, via its popular ride-sharing app, profits from what are effectively black markets. You can't blame drivers and fleet owners for being upset - they are playing by the rules. The thing is, those rules are asinine. They limit competition, reduce supply, diminish quality and force up prices. They should have been done away with decades ago.</p><p>So how do you level the playing field without ignoring the march of technology? Regulating Uber and other car-sharing services into submission would be self-defeating. Whatever bylaw ecosystem Toronto's bureaucrats come up with, the final version should look more like Uber than the outdated and indefensible cartel system that currently controls the taxi business in many cities.</p><p>In Toronto, for instance, anyone can get a permit to drive a cab as long as they can pass a few minor hurdles and cough up $634. So far, so reasonable. But the number of cars is strictly controlled by the city licensing system. There may be lots of drivers, but there's an artificial shortage of cabs.</p><p>That's not good for the customer or the economy, because the cab owners and dispatch companies don't have to compete. The result, among other things, can be run-down, smelly cars that have no business being in service. Or worse. In Paris, for instance, when you call for a cab, the driver immediately turns on the meter and charges you for the time it takes to come pick you up. That's indefensible, but enforceable through a cartel.</p><p>The cartel system also hurts drivers. They know there is always someone coming up behind them willing to work longer hours and for less, for whoever owns the car they drive. In Toronto, if a driver manages against all odds to get a new taxicab licence, they have to pay a ridiculous $4,742 for it. Or they can buy an older, existing licence from its owner for well over $100,000.</p><p>For what good reason is it so expensive to get into the business of driving a car for hire? There is no evidence - none - that Uber drivers and cars are less safe than municipally licensed ones. Uber has demonstrated that there is little public interest in defending an artificial cartel system that enriches licence-holders to the detriment of everyone else.</p><p>If cities are to keep their hand in the taxi business, let it be a light touch. Require all drivers-for-hire, Uber and otherwise, to buy a modestly priced permit at City Hall. Demand a minimum amount of insurance coverage for each driver. Then get out of the way and let the market roll.</p>, <p>Rachel Notley is one hell of a negotiator. She is also the new belle of the climate-change ball. On the eve of the federal-provincial gabfest on climate change, she delivered a big, shiny present - a plan that makes both Alberta and Canada look good. No more rogue nation! We're leaders, not laggards. We can take this to Paris with our heads held high.</p><p>No wonder Prime Minister Justin Trudeau tweeted his congratulations. She came through just in time.</p><p>Ms. Notley's plan is highly aspirational. It is intended to lead Alberta to a promised land that is both prosperous and green. But it won't be cheap. It imposes an extra $3-billion a year in carbon taxes, at a time when the provincial economy is sinking and job losses number in the tens of thousands. Even so, she has managed to get everyone on side - not just the environmental groups, but also the oil industry. Industry executives are positively rapturous. 'This plan will make one of the world's largest oil-producing regions a leader in addressing the climate-change challenge,' said Steve Williams, CEO of Suncor.</p><p>Translation: Alberta is doing its fair share, so you can lay off now. Please approve some pipelines, and get off our case about dirty oil. The NDP Premier and the industry are on the same page.</p><p>For the industry, this deal must come as a relief. Things could have been much, much worse. The industry is at the table, not shut out of the room. It now has policy certainty. (There's nothing business hates more than a fog of doubt about what some crazy government might do.)</p><p>The industry is getting some good PR for a change, which it desperately needs. It even has the stamp of approval from a left-wing government.</p><p>Also, not much will come out of its hide. The carbon taxes will be economy-wide, which means that consumers will bear much of the pain, in the form of higher heating costs and prices at the pump. Also, for now, Alberta's overall carbon emissions will be allowed to grow. There are no hard targets for emissions cuts - only a broad commitment that emissions will begin to fall below today's levels by 2030. The coal plants that will be shut were slated to close anyway. The new cap on dirty oil emissions is so high that the oil sands will be able to grow another 43 per cent - roughly until the year 2030.</p><p>Mr. Trudeau and the other premiers are thrilled. But perhaps they shouldn't be. For all of its ambitions, Alberta's climate plan won't advance the climate goal to which Canada has already committed. In its waning days, the Harper government (oh, irony) pledged that by 2030, Canada would cut greenhouse-gas emissions by 30 per cent below 2005 levels. This is a much, much bigger promise than the one Alberta has just made. Even so, the new Environment Minister, Catherine McKenna, says that target is just a 'floor.' Which means the rest of Canada would have to come through with impossibly deep cuts to meet the target - so deep that no one can describe how it could be done.</p><p>Most Canadians (including far too many politicians) believe that doing our bit for climate change wouldn't be too hard. People want to do the right thing. They imagine we could get there with slightly higher gas taxes, more efficiencies and tougher regulations for the oil patch. Unfortunately, it's not that easy. Alberta's proposed carbon tax, for example, will amount to seven cents a litre at the pump - noticeable, but certainly not enough to change people's behaviour or even pry them from their SUVs. That would require far higher taxes - maybe 10 times higher, or more. Voters wouldn't stand for it.</p><p>It's simply not possible to cut emissions 30 per cent without massive economic damage - something no government will impose. The proposition becomes even more unworkable when you consider that, by 2030, Canada will have grown by an estimated four million people.</p><p>Meantime, the premiers have made their views clear. They're all hot to trot to save the planet - so long as they, not Mr. Trudeau, call the shots. They want him to send them lots of lovely money to do it. That's what all federal-provincial meetings come down to in the end: Send them the money and they'll go home happy.</p><p>As for what Mr. Trudeau will say at Paris, here's a guess: It will be a triumph of marketing.</p>, <p>If you live in Toronto and haven't been paying much attention to Ontario's new premier, better start. Kathleen Wynne's campaign for new taxes or tolls to fund transit is a striking act of political leadership. Toronto's future as a thriving, mobile community depends on its success.</p><p>Take a moment to absorb how bold Ms. Wynne is being here.</p><p>For a generation and more, proposing road tolls to pay for transit and other transportation needs has been considered the equivalent of political suicide. No premier, mayor or other major political figure has dared to table the array of tolls and other levies that Ms. Wynne is now talking openly about.</p><p>Dalton McGuinty, her predecessor, ran for the hills at the thought of angering motorists by tolling highways. Even David Miller, this city's transit-loving mayor in the 2000s, backed away from the notion of tolls in his first mayoral campaign. Now along comes Ms. Wynne. Not long after becoming Ontario's 25th premier in February, she started dropping hints about the need to find new ways to pay for transit. After all the craven ducking and weaving of the past, it seemed hard to believe. Was it just a trial balloon, or is she for real? She is.</p><p>At an event at the Spadina-subway extension site last month, she said straight out that 'We need to create a new revenue stream' to pay for future transit projects. At a Toronto Region Board of Trade speech on Monday, she drove home the point, saying there was no extra money in the treasury for the massive investments required and that it was time to find new sources. Later in the week, she called reporters to her office for one-on-one interviews on the subject, telling them that people are fed up with gridlock and want action. 'Somebody has to take on the difficult politics ... and I'm going to take this on,' she told the Toronto Star.</p><p>Oh, it's bold all right. Consider the odds against her. She leads a minority government and might have to face the voters any day. Both opposition leaders, Tory and NDP, are threatening to jump all over her if she persists with her campaign for transit-funding tools. So is the mayor of Toronto, whose reaction to the idea is to make a retching noise.</p><p>Polls show that voters are far from convinced by her arguments. A new poll for the CivicAction group showed that while 71 per cent of residents of the Greater Toronto and Hamilton region are indeed fed up with gridlock, just 43 per cent think new sources of funding are needed for The Big Move, the $50-billion Metrolinx plan to build out the transit network. Thirty-nine per cent think existing government funds should cover the cost. Another poll this month showed that only about a third of Toronto-region residents favour new taxes and tolls for transit.</p><p>Still, it's encouraging that a premier should take the transit dearth so seriously that she is willing to go this far out on a limb. And, who knows, she might succeed. Residents know that Toronto is decades behind many other major cities in building a mass-transit network. They know transit is expensive and that the money has to come from somewhere.</p><p>People like a leader who takes a stand. Ms. Wynne might not enjoy the comparison, but Margaret Thatcher showed that. The new premier is passionate about this issue and it shows. She is convincing when she says that the Toronto region cannot afford more do-nothing years. Now that she has nailed her colours to the mast, voters are beginning to take notice. They might not like the message at first, but many will rally around as the debate begins in earnest and she starts to make her case.</p><p>'I'm impressed with her commitment and her frankness and her honesty,' says Adam Vaughan, the downtown city councillor. He remembers what Lady Thatcher once said: 'If you want something said, ask a man; if you want something done, ask a woman.'</p><p>When it comes to making progress on transit, Kathleen Wynne may be just the woman Toronto needs.</p>, <p>John Ibbitson is a CIGI senior fellow, an award-winning writer and leading political journalist in Canada. Currently on a one-year leave from The Globe and Mail, John is researching, writing and speaking on Canadian foreign policy at CIGI while he works on a new book.</p><p>Forget the Senate scandal: the Conservatives are on the brink of an even greater fiasco, one that could tarnish Stephen Harper's legacy and brand this Conservative majority government a failure. Worse, far worse, it puts APTA at risk.</p><p>Forgive me: in a world filled with acronyms, I've just invented another, and it's for something that doesn't even exist yet. But APTA represents the world's best possible future, and it hinges on Canada and Germany coming to terms.</p><p>Last year, this country and the European Union signed the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, or CETA. The deal is vitally important to both sides. The Harper government is determined to make Canada's vertical (Canada-U.S.) trading economy more horizontal (Canada-Europe and Canada-Pacific). CETA is the first step in that transformation.</p><p>For its part, the European Union desperately needs a win after almost a decade of economic crises and other reverses.</p><p>But the text of the agreement still hasn't been released, and reports on both sides of the Atlantic say ISDS is the reason. ISDS stands for 'investor-state dispute settlement.' It provides a means whereby corporations can sue governments that violate the terms of an agreement, such as CETA.</p><p>Germany is being sued by a Swedish company for deciding to phase out its nuclear power plants. If the German press is to be believed, this has made German Chancellor Angela Merkel gun-shy over ISDS. Germany wants the provision taken out of CETA. Canada won't sign without it.</p><p>A representative for International Trade Minister Ed Fast says reports of CETA's demise are exaggerated. But almost a year after the agreement was initialed, the text still hasn't been released, so something is clearly wrong.</p><p>The Americans are watching the Canada-EU negotiations closely. They are in trade talks of their own with Europe, known as TTIP (Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership). If CETA fails, then TTIP is doomed. That would be a global tragedy.</p><p>Why? Think of what happens if CETA and TTIP get signed. It would then only be a matter of ironing out details to merge the two agreements to create NATA, the North Atlantic Trade Area. Europe and the two most advanced economies in North America would exist inside a free-trade zone, one that not only eliminates tariffs, but also establishes rules for intellectual property and government procurement, and even reduces (in a preliminary way) agriculture subsidies.</p><p>And even that would be mere overture. The United States and Canada are deeply immersed in TPP, the Trans Pacific Partnership, a potential trade agreement that would involve 10 other developed (Japan, Australia, New Zealand and Singapore) and emerging (Malaysia, Vietnam, Mexico, Chile, Peru and Brunei) Pacific economies.</p><p>If Canada, Europe and the United States can nail down their trade agreements, then this would offer a huge incentive to finally conclude the TPP. And suddenly we would live in a world in which Europe, most of North and South America and much of the Pacific are operating under near-identical economic rules.</p><p>If all sides could be convinced to, once and for all, abandon the foolish crutch of agriculture subsidies, then there would be nothing to prevent the harmonization of the European and Pacific trade agreements. We would have APTA: the Atlantic-Pacific Trade Area.</p><p>That would leave the world effectively divided into three economic blocs: APTA, representing the developed and much of the developing world; the emerging powerhouses known as the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa); and Everybody Else (E2). The real questions would then be: Will India, China and Brazil join APTA or remain outside?</p><p>Over time, they would almost certainly join. Brazil would want the same trading advantage that Chile and Peru would enjoy under APTA; India is already showing interest in joining the global trading economy; China would be better off inside (and trying to dominate) APTA than outside. Once China, India and Brazil are inside APTA, any government on the planet that wants to export would have to join. The globalization of trade would be complete.</p><p>The stakes are even higher than they seem. Dark forces are trying to drag the world back into its violent, protectionist past: Russia is putting 70 years of peace in Europe at risk; Islamic fundamentalists would plunge the Middle East and northern Africa into a new dark age. War and famine still stalk too many lands.</p><p>Against this shadow stands globalization, a universal movement to bring the world closer together by promoting the free flow of goods, people and ideas. Globalization encourages creativity, innovation, productivity and peace. It accelerates the future.</p><p>Without CETA, everything is put at risk - and, as a minor side-effect, Stephen Harper suffers a potentially career-ending defeat. With CETA, everything becomes possible. It's as simple as that.</p><p>Along with other CIGI experts, Mr. Ibbitson will be contributing at www.cigionline.org/blogs, where this post was originally published.</p>, <p>On Oct. 1, Ontario doctors will see their fees cut by 1.3 per cent. This is on top of a 3.15-per-cent fee cut that was imposed in February.</p><p>The province has also imposed targeted fee cuts in a number of areas such as diagnostic imaging and diabetes management, and set a cap on total billings, creating the real possibility that, come year's end, doctors will not be paid for work performed.</p><p>Not to mention that, when fees are capped, doctors have to absorb the cost of additional care required because of population growth and aging.</p><p>All of these clawbacks have been imposed unilaterally after the Ontario Medical Association declined an offer calling for a 2.65-per-cent cut. (The OMA's offer of a two-year wage freeze was rejected; its previous contract also featured fee rollbacks.)</p><p>The Ontario government is resorting to these bully-boy tactics because it wants to cut spending. And it thinks it can get away with it because 'fat cat' doctors don't garner a lot of public sympathy.</p><p>Among physicians, frustrations are boiling over, particularly that their only recourse is venting on social media. Regardless of what doctors are paid, they deserve a fair shake in labour negotiations, and not to be treated in a heavy-handed and undemocratic manner.</p><p>In recent days, provincial Health Minister Eric Hoskins and Ontario Medical Association president Michael Toth have exchanged letters in The London Free Press, both cranking up the rhetoric.</p><p>The OMA argues the cuts are going to affect patient care, and paints doctors as selfless defenders of beleaguered patients. The minister counters that the cuts are not affecting care, and that scaremongering is unprofessional.</p><p>While this may be entertaining, it is no way to negotiate, or resolve the system's woes.</p><p>Ontario currently spends $11.8-billion on physician payments, and wants to cut that by $580-million; it's pretty safe to assume access to care will be affected eventually.</p><p>Rather than setting random targets for spending cuts, the real question that needs to be asked is: Are we getting value for money for the money spent on 33,600 family doctors, specialists and residents?</p><p>Nobody really knows. We don't know if the services individual physicians provide are useful or cost-effective.</p><p>We don't even really know how much they are paid: Unlike British Columbia, Ontario does not publish individual doctor billings, and no province calculates the real cost of expenses.</p><p>What we know is that physicians have, on average, gross billings of slightly more than $328,000 (a figure that varies widely based on specialty) but, like small businesses, have to pay their operating expenses (which also vary dramatically between specialties and cities) out of those fees.</p><p>Doctors do not have pensions or benefits and, with medical-school tuition fees hovering around $25,000 a year, tend to have enormous debts. And don't forget that it can take up to 12 years of training to become a specialist.</p><p>While doctors earn a good income, there is little evidence they are overpaid.</p><p>But that doesn't mean they are paid sensibly either. Fee-for-service payment, which is commonplace, encourages volume, not quality. The complexity of care means interdisciplinary teams are the best way to treat patients, but creating sensible teams is difficult when you negotiate contracts of different professions separately. But, most of all, we need to find a way of paying health professionals - beginning with doctors - in a manner that rewards results.</p><p>These fundamental reforms are going to take time and require long, complex negotiations. They aren't going to happen in an atmosphere of distrust and punitive clawbacks.</p><p>The government needs to get back to the negotiating table and hash out a deal. Several other provinces - including Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Quebec - have done so recently, in a similarly challenging fiscal environment.</p><p>If negotiating doesn't work, then the province needs to agree to binding arbitration, especially because doctors do not have the legal right to strike.</p><p>Playing hardball may serve the government's interests in the short term but, in the long term, it just delays the inevitable.</p><p>As Warren Winkler, the former judge who prepared a conciliator's report on the dispute, noted, without fundamental system change, the government will not be able to achieve savings, and physicians will not be able to provide adequate care.</p><p>That's a lose-lose, with the ultimate loser being patients.</p>, <p>A recent survey ranking the best and worst of Canada's longest-serving prime ministers was enough to induce apoplexy among Conservative supporters: Liberal PMs occupied six of the first seven spots.</p><p>At the bottom end, Tory PMs took five of the six positions. Stephen Harper finished 10th. To find a Conservative prime minister held in high esteem required going back to the 19th century's John A. Macdonald, according to a Maclean's magazine survey of 123 political specialists.</p><p>Baloney! retorted Conservatives in online posts about the survey's findings. Nothing but codswallop! The so-called experts, they complained, were mainly academics who are chiefly Liberal. There was some basis for that complaint; academics Stephen Azzi and Norman Hillmer, who conducted the survey in late summer, told me that most of the respondents had indeed voted Liberal. But the responses from Conservatives who took part weren't all that different, they said. For example, Mr. Harper finished ninth among Conservative responders, only one spot better than the overall finding.</p><p>Lawrence Martin: Why the Liberals risk a drop in public trust</p><p>Lawrence Martin: PMs and the press: Hostilities are the hallmark</p><p>Read more from public-affairs columnist Lawrence Martin</p><p>While some may dispute these particular results, other soundings, including public opinion polls about the popularity of prime ministers, have yielded roughly similar results.</p><p>Among reasons why Conservatives fare so poorly, we might consider leadership personality. In two weeks, we'll be marking the first year of Liberal PM Justin Trudeau's governance. There's been much comment about his personification of power and how the charm offensive has struck a chord with the public, compared with the approach of Mr. Harper.</p><p>But rather than being an exceptional case, this is part of a pattern. Having prime ministers who are an uncomfortable fit for the people is a problem that has long plagued Tory leaders; their personas came to grate on the public. Most left office unliked, unwanted. Consider the vainglorious Arthur Meighen, or R.B. Bennett, who was derided, sometimes not unfairly, as a pompous ass. John Diefenbaker began on a high note but came to be viewed as a messianic blowhard bordering on the unhinged. Young Joe Clark was green and gawky, Brian Mulroney too slick by half, Mr. Harper needlessly malevolent.</p><p>Liberal PMs, an exception being the lugubrious but successful William Lyon Mackenzie King, had personal styles that worked better. Think of Wilfrid Laurier, or Louis St. Laurent (who went by Uncle Louis) or Lester Pearson, Jean Chretien and the Trudeaus.</p><p>The Maclean's survey ranked the long-serving PMs (those who held office for at least four years) as follows: 1) Mackenzie King; 2) Laurier; 3) Macdonald; 4) Pierre Trudeau; 5) Mr. Pearson; 6) St. Laurent; 7) Mr. Chretien; 8) Mr. Mulroney; 9) Robert Borden; 10) Mr. Harper; 11) Mr. Diefenbaker; 12) Alexander Mackenzie; 13) Bennett.</p><p>A separate ranking was done for the 10 PMs who held office a short time. Aside from the incumbent Justin Trudeau, it's not a list one craves to be on and here again Conservatives come out on the short end: seven on the list are Tories. Of the three Liberals, Mr. Trudeau and Paul Martin are ranked highest.</p><p>Beyond the question of personal appeal, scholars cite other reasons for the big Liberal-Tory divide. The sweet spot in Canadian politics is neither left nor right, but the progressive centre. And that has usually been the Liberals' natural habitat. There is, Mr. Azzi said, 'a distinctly Canadian style of leadership that involves compromise and accommodation.' Liberal PMs, an exception being Pierre Trudeau, have been better at that.</p><p>Conservative PMs, in the view of Mr. Hillmer, could never get it right with Quebec the way Liberal leaders did. Mr. Mulroney was a welcome deviation; he got Quebec aboard the Tory train until his alliance with Lucien Bouchard derailed it.</p><p>Liberal prime ministers benefited from the luck of timing. Laurier and St. Laurent governed in unusually prosperous times. How could they not fare better than an R.B. Bennett who served in the Great Depression?</p><p>It all started so auspiciously for the Conservatives: Macdonald, our first prime minister, was a leader of compromise and accommodation. His vision was national. He set the template for the governing of the disparate country.</p><p>But it was the Liberal PMs who picked up on that template more so than the Tories. Both from a personal and policy point of view, they've melded more comfortably into our mainstream political culture.</p>, <p>When the Supreme Court opened the door to legally assisted death last week, I imagined I could hear my mom applauding. She did not believe in unnecessary suffering. She did not have a good death. The terrible pain she experienced made her last weeks on Earth a living hell.</p><p>But the option of assisted death will do very little to address the bigger problem we face. Without broad changes in medical and social practices, a 'good death' will probably continue to elude most of us. Ideally, we'd all live in robust health till age 95, then die quietly in our sleep. In the real world, few of us will be so lucky. For most, the slow march toward the end will be marked by a lurching slide into increasing debility, punctuated by repeated hospitalization and painful, often futile treatments. Too many of us will die in institutions, hooked up to machines, with chemo in our blood - victims of all the best modern medicine has to offer.</p><p>What really matters in the end? This is the question American surgeon Atul Gawande tackles in his book Being Mortal - an utterly unflinching yet compassionate account of old age and end-of-life issues. If you have any older people in your life, or plan to be one yourself some day, you need to read it.</p><p>Dr. Gawande points out that most physicians are miserable at talking to their patients about death. One study found that two-thirds of terminal cancer patients reported having had no discussion with their doctors about goals for end-of-life care - even though they were on average just four months from death. A recent Canadian study found that nearly half of all cancer patients still die in a hospital, rather than in a hospice or at home.</p><p>For doctors, death is a defeat. Their every impulse is to treat, even when treatment probably won't prolong life and may well inflict more suffering. 'We imagine that we can wait until the doctors tell us that there is nothing more they can do,' Dr. Gawande says. 'But rarely is there nothing more that doctors can do ... We fall back on the default, and the default is: Do Something. Fix Something.'</p><p>Brian Goldman, a Canadian emergency-room doctor, couldn't agree more. 'It's the rare physician who prepares patients to die well, or who will even acknowledge that death is possible, much less imminent,' he wrote last month in Chatelaine.</p><p>There's another problem. Institutional indifference, callousness and failure can (and often does) defeat our good intentions. That's what happened to my mom.</p><p>During her last year of life, it was increasingly obvious that she was sick. She lost a lot of weight and complained that she was in pain. But, probably because she knew the truth, she refused to see a doctor about it. Finally, when the pain became unbearable, she agreed to go. He sent her for a test, which showed a 'mass' in her abdomen. He wouldn't tell us what that meant, but he didn't sound optimistic. It turned out to be advanced pancreatic cancer.</p><p>Mom wound up in one of the best hospitals in Canada. 'All I want is something for the pain,' she begged as we waited for her to be admitted. I promised she would get it. The doctors and nurses told us not to worry - they would control the pain. But they didn't. For some inexplicable reason, the pain medication was severely rationed, and she was suffering epic waves of pain. We complained to everyone in sight, but it did no good. I would sit with her and beg her to hang in there until the scheduled time came for her next dose. One night, when it failed to arrive, I frantically hunted down the nurse, who told me snippily that he didn't have time to attend to Mom because he had paperwork to do.</p><p>This kind of institutional malpractice, I've learned, is not terribly unusual. Doctors have told me it happens all the time. Still, I feel that I profoundly failed my mom. She asked me for just one thing, and she didn't get it.</p><p>My point is that the vast majority of the frail, the elderly and dying - people like my mother - don't need assisted death to ease their passing. What they really need is a vast culture change in the way we care for them. What they and their families need is the assurance that simple compassion and humanity will not be smothered by complex systems and bureaucracy. Unfortunately, no law can guarantee that.</p>, <p>Forces are lining up against the bid by Porter Airlines to get permission to fly jets out of the Toronto island airport. That is a shame, because many of the objections to allowing jets are weak or capable of being resolved with a little effort.</p><p>When Porter first made its proposal, the biggest concerns were about noise from the jets and how a lengthened runway would encroach on the harbour and the lake. Those concerns have since faded.</p><p>A report from City of Toronto staff concedes that the Bombardier CS100 jets that Porter wants to fly would 'likely' meet existing noise limits, even if we won't know for sure till the plane is certified by next May. An attached consultants report says the plane is 'expected to be certified with noise levels similar' to the turboprops Porter flies at present and that the new planes should 'operate at or below' current noise limits.</p><p>In any case, Bombardier has guaranteed Porter that the plane will meet the limits. Consultants also conclude that the new jets - part of a quieter, cleaner new generation of aviation technology - will meet air-pollution standards.</p><p>As for the runway, Porter wants to lengthen it by up to 200 metres on each end to let the jets land and take off. Opponents say this would mean 'paving the lake,' as Adam Vaughan, Porter's fiercest city-council critic, once put it. But the consultants who reported on the issue found that the longer runway would 'maintain the existing depth' of the current Marine Exclusion Zone, a buoyed-off area to keep boats away from planes. In other words, boats would still have just as much room in the harbour, though the buoyed zone might have to be widened slightly for the rebuilt runway.</p><p>With the greater noise and lake-paving arguments debunked, opponents have been shifting their line of attack. They now say it is not so much what would happen to noise levels or the lake waters that is the issue. It is what would happen on the ground. Mr. Vaughan argues that it would cost as much as half a billion dollars to build better infrastructure to deal with the increased traffic that jets would bring to the airport.</p><p>Spending that much would be extravagant and, fortunately, it should not be necessary. The number of flights that can travel in and out of the island is limited by the fact that it has only one runway. The number of slots for arriving and departing planes is expected to remain the same.</p><p>The number of passengers could go up regardless because the jets are bigger and carry more passengers than the turboprops. Consultants estimate it could lead to an 'incremental increase' in the airport's capacity, to 4.3 million passengers a year from 3.8 million at present. In a high-growth scenario, that could grow to 4.8 million. But if the worry is that the airport will just keep growing and growing with no end in sight, why not negotiate with Porter to put a cap on the number of annual passengers?</p><p>The passenger tunnel currently being built under the Western Gap should ease the flow of the increased traffic. More work will be needed to make sure that vehicular and other travel to the airport from the city side does not grow tangled, as it can do even now.</p><p>This is the most legitimate of the concerns about the jets proposal, but it is far from insuperable. The city staff report's estimate of $180-million to $300-million for ground-side infrastructure includes expensive projects like tunnels, bridges and streetcar lines that may not be necessary. Better airport shuttle service and a few road improvements could make a big difference. Consultants put the cost of one round of road upgrades at just $2-million to $3-million.</p><p>The airport is a valuable asset for Toronto. An ambitious city would try to overcome the concerns over introducing jets, not allow itself to be paralyzed by them.</p>, <p>Everyone loves firefighters. They save lives. They are strong and competent. They look good on calendars. People are always happy when they show up.</p><p>But municipalities do not love firefighters. Across Canada, towns and cities are getting hosed by the skyrocketing costs of their fire departments. Thanks to arbitration settlements, your firefighters are the best paid (and possibly the most underworked) guys in town. Firefighters have been getting raises that are twice as high what other public sector workers have been getting, at a time when municipalities are strapped for funds and raises are just a memory for most of us.</p><p>Here in Toronto, firefighters recently won a 14-per-cent wage increase over five years, which means that by next year, a first-class firefighter will be making $90,000. But it's the small towns that are hit worst. Tiny Owen Sound, Ont. (population 32,092), has 29 full-time fire professionals. Last year, 25 of them made more than $100,000. The median full-time income of people who live in Owen Sound is less than half that.</p><p>For smaller cities, the fire department is typically the largest item in the budget. It accounts for upward of a quarter of their costs. But municipalities are powerless to control firefighters' salaries, because negotiations with the union almost always wind up in arbitration. And arbitrators aren't obliged to give much weight to a town's ability to pay. Instead, they simply match the settlements that everybody else got, including police. So the costs spiral ever upward, and towns are forced to cut back on libraries and roads. As Toronto city manager Joe Pennachetti told the Toronto Sun: 'We feel like we're banging our heads against the wall.'</p><p>There's no good reason for salaries to go up so much, argues John Saunders, a consultant with Hicks Morley who advises dozens of municipalities. Firefighting is an extremely desirable job, and vacancies are scarce because people rarely quit. Last year, for example, there were more than 500 applicants for 20 firefighting jobs in the Ontario communities of Cambridge, Kitchener and Waterloo. In Cambridge, a first-class firefighter earns up to $99,397 a year, plus benefits and overtime. Yet despite the high demand for their jobs, firefighters get 'retention' payments for not quitting.</p><p>Working conditions are pretty sweet too. Thanks to modern safety standards, there are very few fires left to fight. These days, most fire department calls are medical. To prove that they're still needed, fire departments have been adding defibrillators and Jaws of Life, and frantically expanding their repertoires to respond to even minor non-fire emergencies. Still, there's an awful lot of what we shall euphemistically call 'down time,' which firemen fill by preparing meals, sleeping, watching television, polishing the trucks and rewinding the hoses.</p><p>It's long past time to roll back firefighting costs, as cities across the United States have been forced to do. But in Canada, costs continue to escalate as unions demand even better benefits, shorter work weeks and highly desirable 24-hour shifts. Firefighters love 24-hour shifts because it gives them plenty of time off for their other jobs. Theoretically, they're required to work seven or eight of these shifts in a 28-day period, but workers with plenty of seniority can wind up working just five or six shifts, according to Mr. Saunders. Some critics refer to the 24-hour arrangement as 'a well-paid part-time job.' (As for how it's possible to work 24 hours in a row, the answer is 'down time.')</p><p>Not even the smallest effort to control costs goes unchallenged. In Windsor, the union grieved a decision to pull a fire truck out of service in 2008, saying that the administration had promised to leave it in service until the new contract was settled, which still hasn't happened. The arbitrator sided with the union and told the city to cough up $381,000 in theoretically lost overtime - $1,328 for each member of the fire department. Meanwhile, in Toronto, the firefighters' union continues its endless war against Emergency Medical Services, claiming that a decision to stop dispatching million-dollar pumpers to lower-level 911 calls puts lives at risk. A consultants' report said that a merger of fire and EMS could save the city significant money - but the tribal warfare is so bitter that it will never happen.</p><p>I have nothing against firefighters, personally. But times have changed. We can't go on like this. I could write the same column about the police. You guys are supposed to protect us. But we can't afford you any more.</p>, <p>Ted Menzies is one of nature's gentlemen. He just might be the most popular member of Parliament among his peers. He's the Minister of State for Finance, a junior cabinet post, and he would likely have been promoted in the forthcoming cabinet shuffle.</p><p>Instead, Mr. Menzies is leaving politics. He's told Prime Minister Stephen Harper that he won't be running again. Was he afraid of losing? Are you kidding? He owns the southern Alberta riding of Macleod. He's a member of the Conservatives' '70 per cent club' - Alberta MPs who win more than 70 per cent of a riding's votes. He could have continued his political career as long as he desired. Instead, he'll be doing something else after the next election.</p><p>Mr. Menzies was the last former Alberta Progressive Conservative left in the new Conservative Party created by Stephen Harper. When Mr. Menzies sought the nomination, he ran against a clutch of Reform Party types who cancelled each other out and allowed him to slide to victory. Once nominated, the election was a formality.</p><p>All the other Alberta Conservative MPs are either from the old Reform Party or weren't involved in electoral politics before running for office. With his departure, the Alberta caucus will shift just a bit further to the right.</p><p>Mr. Menzies's moderate breed is rare in Alberta Conservative circles, where most MPs are open or closet supporters of the provincial Wildrose Party. Of course, Mr. Menzies followed his party's script as a cabinet minister, but he was almost anti-partisan, or at least seemed to be, in a party where hyper-partisanship and all-pervasive combat set the tone.</p><p>As the summer cabinet shuffle nears, much breath is being wasted on whether ministerial changes will make much of a difference for a government slumping so badly in the polls. Two years ago, the Conservatives enjoyed twice the support of the Liberals; today, they trail the Liberals by many points. In many polls, the Conservatives have dropped below 30-per-cent support for the first time since they were first elected seven years ago.</p><p>Cabinet shuffles themselves don't change political fortunes. Most voters can't name more than two or three of them. They do know prime ministers, and vote more than anything else on what they think of them. And like other prime ministers, Mr. Harper isn't about to change his demeanour or style after all these years. The Conservatives will win or lose with him, not a new cabinet.</p><p>One wonders, as Mr. Menzies departs, what the government would have been like had his gentlemanly attitude been more on display from this government. A government's tone and style gradually shape an electorate's view. Do people feel comfortable with the men and women running the show? That's usually a more pertinent question than whether this or that policy change is understood, accepted or rejected.</p><p>And this government's tone and style are beginning to wear on more and more Canadians. The ferocious partisanship, the excessive secrecy, the negative television ads, the mendacity directed at opponents, the overwhelming sense that enemies (including most of the media, of course) abound, the almost manic preoccupation with spin and image and now the little scandals from the Senate have created the impression, outside the Conservative core, of a government that has ideology and agenda but not much heart, empathy, feeling or understanding for anyone who doesn't share that ideology and agenda.</p><p>Mr. Menzies smiles a lot, not for effect but because that's the way he is. As such, he stood out in a cabinet full of scowlers. Ask yourself: How many senior Conservatives smile? Most are so scripted by the Prime Minister's Office that they dare not show whatever humour they possess, or they turn it into sarcastic blasts at the opposition.</p><p>There will be a cabinet shuffle soon, and some new faces will appear. They will adapt to the government's tone and style, which are set at the top.</p>, <p>In December, The Program for International Students Assessment (PISA) released the latest international student test results. Unfortunately, the good standing of Canadian education (fourth in reading and top ten in math and science out of 70 countries) was buried by the news that Canadian students' ability in math is on the decline. This 2 per cent decrease in PISA scores, from 527 to 518, sent pundits, parents and politicians into a frenzy.</p><p>After more than a month of popular debate and discussion - and with a potential provincial election looming - Ontario Education Minister Liz Sandals unveiled a math plan to '...battle the province's poor test scores...'. The $4-million initiative placed the responsibility for addressing Ontario students' declining math scores on teachers and parents. Meanwhile, the minister defended the math curriculum and refused to consider a 'shake up' of teaching methods.</p><p>Most of the recent discussion on how we're teaching math in Canadian schools has focussed on who is to blame for the problem and how best to fix it. Almost no one has contemplated whether using international test scores as the basis for education policy decisions is a sound strategy. Canadians have taken PISA's scores and rankings at face value without ever considering if they're correct.</p><p>The 2011 Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) indicated that, contrary to the 2012 PISA results, 'Ontario students have shown significant improvement' in math and more than 70 per cent of Ontario students tested at or above the benchmark. Why are these findings at odds with the PISA findings only a year later?</p><p>There is a growing body of academic evidence that PISA test scores aren't accurate reflections of student learning. Cambridge statistician David Spiegelhalter expressed '...fairly serious concerns...' about PISA's 2012 testing methods and data analysis, while University of Copenhagen's Svend Kreiner calls PISA results 'useless'. Prof. Kreiner also demonstrated that in PISA's 2006 test, Canada could have placed 'anywhere from second place to 25th' using PISA's methodology. Other prominent academic statisticians call PISA results and methods 'utterly wrong' and 'problematic'.</p><p>In response PISA admits that a 'large variation in single ranking positions is likely' owing to 'the uncertainty that results from sample data'. Prof. Spiegelhalter goes further, stating 'It's unwise for countries to base education policy on their Pisa results'. To do so is 'to underestimate the random error associated with the Pisa results', he says.</p><p>In any case, high international test scores may be meaningless. Keith Baker, a U.S. Department of Education researcher, found no correlation between international test scores and prosperity. Education levels help fuel growth up to point, but once a country achieves an optimal level of education, traits like creativity, perseverance and ambition become more important. Mr. Baker believes that constantly pursuing higher test scores is bad education policy, as it reduces the focus in schools on developing those other important traits.</p><p>While it's questionable whether we have a 'crisis' in Canadian math education the discussion and debate around learning math is paving the way forward. In the late 1980's and early 1990's educators and parents heatedly discussed the merits of whole language and phonics approaches in teaching reading. Out of those discussions came balanced literacy programs which use the best of both approaches and have led to our current strength in teaching reading.</p><p>The opposite poles of 'discovery math' and 'back to basics' are theoretical rather than practical. I don't use one method exclusively in my grade 5 classroom, nor do I know any teacher that does. We're using inquiry methods more, but we also use more traditional methods when they're effective.</p><p>The curriculum requires my students to mentally add, subtract, multiply and divide and it's a skill we develop daily. Students also work on open-ended problems and, in doing so, foster higher-order thinking skills. These two approaches aren't an 'either/or', but rather an opportunity to add new strategies to what we know already works.</p><p>The drawback of deciding education policy through public debate is that positions become polarized and the nuance of understanding required to enhance student learning in the classroom is lost. Every student is unique and no single approach will be effective for every student. Similarly, student learning can't be effectively distilled down and represented by a test score.</p><p>International tests, such as PISA provide impartial feedback that encourages us to reflect and consider ways to improve our education system. They are not, however, the definitive word, and should not be used as the basis for policy decisions. The collective future of our students is much too important for that.</p><p>Andrew Campbell is a teacher at Major Ballachey Public School in Brantford, Ont., an educator for over 20 years and the father of three sons.</p>, <p>Changes in Canadian public policy tend to be incremental, but a groundswell seems to be building for a plan that could radically remake our social benefits structure.</p><p>The idea - guaranteed annual income - is not new; it's been argued over by academics since at least the 1940s, and a version was tested in Manitoba in the 1970s. What's different this time is proponents now find themselves in positions of power in municipal governments, provincial legislatures and on Parliament Hill.</p><p>Quebec Premier Philippe Couillard says he's 'dead serious' about trying it, and last month appointed a cabinet committee to that end. It is presided by Labour Minister Francois Blais, a former Laval University political science professor who just happens to have written a book on minimum income programs.</p><p>Last week, another Laval academic - Jean-Yves Duclos, a former economics professor who after his election last year became the federal Families, Children and Social Development Minister - says he too is willing to look at implementing it.</p><p>The concept is simple. Replace the raft of income-support provisions currently administered, means-tested, audited and doled out by various levels of government - welfare, community housing allowances, employment insurance - with a single benefit. It could be run through the tax system. If your income is below a certain level, you get a cheque.</p><p>Many conservatives have long liked the idea, which triggers the same intellectual-pleasure regions as a flat tax and could make government small and more efficient. The suggestion in Quebec is the province could shutter at least one department entirely. That appeals to the austerity-minded wing of Mr. Couillard's cabinet.</p><p>Fans on the left - see Alberta's NDP Finance Minister Joe Ceci, who before politics was an anti-poverty advocate - like the universality and the idea it could reduce income and social inequality.</p><p>The arguments against guaranteed income are also well-established, the main one being that it could act as a disincentive to work. Another is that governments can safely be relied upon to screw things up, as they arguably did in Dauphin, Man.</p><p>It's time to test the assumptions in the real world. Launch some guaranteed annual income pilot programs. Let's see how theory translates into practice in Canada.</p>, <p>Paul Heinbecker, a former ambassador to the UN, is with the Centre for International Governance Innovation, the Balsillie School and Laurier University in Waterloo</p><p>Since just before Christmas, when the United Nations Security Council adopted Resolution 2334 on Israeli settlements, the drama of the fractious personal relationships of Benjamin Netanyahu, Donald Trump and Barack Obama has dominated media coverage. A lot of this commentary is missing the point: The resolution, which passed 14-0-1 (the United States abstained), and its strong objections to Israeli settlement building are more portentous than the transitory political theatre surrounding it.</p><p>Resolution 2334 is important because it joins other milestone UN resolutions, including General Assembly resolution 181 that partitioned Palestine and led to the proclamation of Israel; resolution 194 which resolved that peace-minded refugees of the 1948 war should be permitted to return to their homes; and Security Council resolutions 242 and 338 that emphasized the 'inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by war.' Together these and a small handful of other resolutions guide the judgments of the vast majority of UN member-state governments on Israeli-Palestinian issues.</p><p>Resolution 2334 was passed under Chapter VI of the UN Charter on the peaceful settlement of disputes and thus does not entail enforcement options. The language of resolution 2334 is nonetheless unequivocal that Israel's settlements in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, have 'no legal validity,' that they constitute 'a flagrant violation of international law,' and that they are 'a major obstacle to the achievement of the two-state solution and a just, lasting and comprehensive peace.'</p><p>Israeli and Palestinian narratives notwithstanding, resolution 2334 reflects what the world thinks. It does not constitute a minority view or even a very divided view. If this resolution of the 15-member UN Security Council were put to a vote in the 193-member General Assembly, the outcome would scarcely be different.</p><p>The resolution does not question Israel's right to exist; in fact, if anything it reinforces that right. The resolution invites UN member states to distinguish 'in their relevant dealings between the territory of the state of Israel and the territories occupied since 1967.' At the same time, these distinctions could encourage less positive consequences for Israel. For example, importing states could demand certificates of origin for goods produced by Israeli firms in the occupied territories.</p><p>U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry's follow-up valedictory speech this week endorsed the resolution and detailed the Obama administration's frustration in managing relations with Jerusalem, and in its vain efforts to negotiate peace based on a two-state solution. Mr. Kerry's speech - some called it a eulogy for a Palestinian state - was directed variously at Americans, Israelis and the international community and echoed many of the themes of the resolution. Mr. Kerry uncharacteristically directly criticized the Israeli government for being, in Mr. Netanyahu's own words, 'more committed to settlements than any in Israel's history' and expressed particular frustration that the settler agenda, which opposes a Palestinian state, was defining Israel's future. 'If the choice is one state, Israel can either be Jewish or democratic; it cannot be both and it will not ever really be at peace,' Mr. Kerry said.</p><p>Mr. Kerry was mindful that influential voices in Mr. Trump's transition team and in the Israeli cabinet, including ministers Naftali Bennett and Ayelet Shaked, have spoken favourably of Israel's annexing the West Bank altogether. Meanwhile, a Pew poll earlier this year found that nearly half of Israeli Jews said Arabs should be expelled or transferred from Israel and that 79 per cent of Israeli Jews agreed that Israel should give preferential treatment to Jews.</p><p>Mr. Kerry used his speech to suggest six goals to guide future peace negotiations: secure and recognized international borders based on the 1967 lines with mutually agreed land swaps; two states for two peoples with mutual recognition and full equal rights for their minority citizens; a just, agreed, fair and realistic solution to the Palestinian refugee issue; Jerusalem as the capital of both states; an end to the occupation; and renunciation of all claims by both sides. But Mr. Kerry appeared to scotch the rumour that the Security Council would endorse these principles before Mr. Obama leaves office.</p><p>Mr. Netanyahu is apparently counting on his ability to persuade president-elect Trump and the U.S. Congress to back his policies. But even if they do, neither will be able to erase resolution 2334. The great majority of UN member governments, including powerful ones like Russia and China, still want to see a two-state solution, and U.S. veto power is unavailing in these circumstances. Nor would U.S. defunding of the UN reverse this resolution; the U.S. has defaulted on its contributions before and the UN has survived. And, if the U.S. were to walk away from the UN, as some suggest, who would shield Israel then? Perhaps as a precaution, nevertheless, we should dust off plans for the UN to move to Canada.</p>, <p>Prime Minister Stephen Harper should clarify whether he thinks the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court acted inappropriately, as he appears to have alleged. We say 'appears' because Mr. Harper is being passive-aggressive with regard to this matter, tossing out an accusation that doesn't seem to have any basis in law or fact, and then refusing to comment.</p><p>Mr. Harper issued a statement last week saying Chief Justice Beverley McLachlin tried to contact him last year, when rumours were circulating in legal circles that he was preparing to name a Federal Court judge to one of the three high court spots reserved for Quebeckers. The potential appointment of Marc Nadon was contentious, since Mr. Nadon was not a member of the Quebec bar, and that appeared to disqualify him under the terms of the Supreme Court Act. Mr. Harper went ahead regardless, the appointment was immediately challenged, and the government referred the issue to the Supreme Court itself. The justices ruled 6-1 that the appointment didn't meet the requirements of the law; Chief Justice McLachlin was one of the six in the majority.</p><p>Chief Justice McLachlin has not hidden the fact she attempted to contact the Prime Minister, nor should she. As Chief Justice, she is expected to consult with the government about the needs of the court. It is fair to say that she wanted to signal an issue that might delay the arrival of a new justice and leave her short a body for an extended period - which, of course, is exactly what has happened.</p><p>Since her communication with the PMO occurred before Mr. Nadon's appointment, it is hard to see how Chief Justice McLachlin was interfering with an active case, since there was no case until several months later. Still, if the government was truly concerned about her neutrality, its lawyers could have asked her to recuse herself from the reference case. They did not.</p><p>Ten months later, Mr. Harper is suddenly calling into question the appropriateness of the Chief Justice's actions, after the court has ruled against his government. It is entirely appropriate for the PM to criticize a court decision, and criticize this decision he has. Fair enough. But taking petty potshots at the Chief Justice's professionalism? It undermines confidence in one of our most vital institutions. It also undermines confidence in Mr. Harper.</p>, <p>It's worth watching the documentary Flora: Scenes from a Leadership Convention to see how much has changed in 40 years (goodbye, plaid pantsuits and comb-overs!) and how much has not (Hello, female political leaders! Hello? Hello?).</p><p>In 1976, Flora MacDonald ran for the leadership of the Progressive Conservatives, one of the first women to vie for top spot of a major Canadian political party. She lost, you may recall, to Joe Clark. The documentary by Peter Raymont shows her as the remarkable, dignified and groundbreaking politician we knew her to be. (Ms. MacDonald died last month at the age of 89; the Prime Minister did not attend her funeral.)</p><p>'Because women do not perceive of themselves in the role of a leader,' she said during her campaign, 'it is difficult for them to perceive of another woman in the role of a leader. The more that position is tried for by women, the more it explodes that myth.'</p><p>Her adviser, savvy Eddie Goodman, was more pithy: 'The country was ready for a woman leader. The party was not.'</p><p>Was Canada ready for a female leader? Is it now? The evidence would suggest not. We had one, once, for several months 22 years ago, but Kim Campbell did not win an election to become prime minister. The days of the NDP's Audrey McLaughlin and Alexa McDonough are fading fast in the rear-view mirror.</p><p>How about this election? There's a lot of testosterone up there on those debate stages. At least the Green Party's Elizabeth May will be around for some of the debates (although not the one hosted by this newspaper).</p><p>The last federal election in 2011 was seen as a breakthrough because 25 per cent of MPs were women. I'd call it a breakthrough if it were 75 per cent; I'd settle for parity. Although the nominations for this election haven't closed yet, of the candidates that have been named for ridings, only 30 per cent are women, according to the advocacy group Equal Voice. In 55 ridings, there are no female candidates.</p><p>There is 'still a lot of work to be done,' Equal Voice's Nancy Peckford says on the phone from Ottawa. She talks about the 'incumbency advantage' that accrues to electoral veterans. 'Once we've achieved those breakthroughs, we are generally able to hold on to them. But it is infusing new women in the system that is the challenge.'</p><p>The barriers to women's political participation are well studied. Some are internal, it can't be denied: Women are generally more anxious than male candidates about how they will be perceived on the campaign trail, and are perhaps put off by the belligerent dysfunctionality of the system.</p><p>But more important are the external factors: the exclusionary riding associations, the denial of long-standing support systems and financial backing.</p><p>As a report this year from the World Bank's Women in Parliaments project put it, 'While both men and women express concern about the many pitfalls of political campaigning, females are more worried over all, particularly about gender discrimination, the difficulty of fundraising, negative advertising, the loss of privacy, and not being taken seriously.'</p><p>Female candidates receive fewer private donations, the report found, and women by a wide margin are underrepresented at the ministerial levels.</p><p>Recently, Ms. Campbell talked about a gender-quota system to ensure fairness in federal elections. This was met by predictable shrieks of outrage by people who think historically biased systems of governance will magically sort themselves out with the wave of some fairy godmother's wand. Make that fairy godfather.</p><p>While I don't agree with the former prime minister on the specifics of her suggestion (two candidates elected per riding, one male and one female), I think she is right about quotas. Quotas are not an anomaly; they are the norm in many parts of the world. In terms of women represented in political office, Canada ranks 46th out of 140 countries, according to the Inter-Parliamentary Union.</p><p>Many of the countries that do better than us have some formal system of promoting women into office, through reserved seats or candidates' lists or mentorship programs. Many of those countries use a proportional representation system, it's true, but there's not much we can do about that.</p><p>Almost 100 countries have some form of gender quotas in politics, whether legislated or voluntary, at the level of parliaments or at the level of party recruitment. Germany is one of them: It hasn't worked so badly there, has it?</p>, <p>The U.S. presidential election, starring Donald Trump and a growing cast of antagonists, is now officially stranger than fiction, and more estranged from reality than the most implausible reality TV plot. Mr. Trump, who has spent the past week expanding and deepening his enemies' list, may now be in the process of losing the election. He is definitely in the advanced stages of losing the Republican Party, or at least its traditional establishment.</p><p>Is Mr. Trump self-destructing, and melting down in a sea of his own indiscipline, narcissism and stubborn unwillingness to moderate his message or his behaviour? Maybe. But voting day isn't until November, and three months is a heck of a long time in politics.</p><p>And until last week, almost everything had been going The Donald's way. Despite changing nothing after the end of the primaries, and continuing a campaign whose style is off-the-cuff chaos and whose message is fear, his polls numbers climbed through the early summer. He came out of the Republican National Convention in a dead heat with Hillary Clinton. Considering that mainstream Republican politicians had been saying since last year that Mr. Trump could never be nominated, and if nominated would lose the general election in a landslide, Mr. Trump's rising prospects were an accomplishment and a surprise.</p><p>But this may be the week where Trump being Trump finally started to undo him. Until now, the more he disrespected rivals, tagging them with elementary schoolyard taunts - Little Marco Rubio, Lyin' Ted Cruz, #CrookedHillary - the more at least some voters warmed to what they took to be his unscripted, politically incorrect honesty. His daily emission of odd and crazy pronouncements, which would have been fatal gaffes for any other candidate; his inability to feel shame or embarrassment or remorse; even his repeated self-contradictions on virtually every policy save for the desire to build The Great Anti-Mexican Wall, all were somehow translating into greater popularity.</p><p>This week, however, Mr. Trump went after Khizr Khan, the father of a Muslim-American soldier killed fighting in Iraq. Mr. Khan had taken the stage at the Democratic National Convention to attack Mr. Trump, and Mr. Trump spent the next few days pushing back rather than moving on. Many Republicans immediately distanced themselves from the candidate. Even his vice-presidential running mate, Mike Pence described Mr. Khan's son as 'an American hero,' whose family 'should be cherished by every American.'</p><p>Then Mr. Trump refused to endorse the candidacies of several senior Republican senators who are up for re-election. Mr. Trump's fights with other Republicans were understandable when he was running to take over the party and wrest it from a hostile establishment. But now that he's the name at the top of the ticket, why try to publicly undermine Senators Paul Ryan, John McCain and Kelly Ayotte? Good question. Because after Mr. Trump refused to endorse them, his running mate Mr. Pence did the exact opposite.</p><p>While all of that was happening, the list of prominent Republicans denouncing Mr. Trump was growing. It includes at least one GOP congressman who is urging his constituents to vote for Ms. Clinton, and Hewlett Packard Enterprise CEO and former California gubernatorial candidate Meg Whitman, who is fundraising for her.</p><p>Analysis: Why the world wants Clinton to win</p><p>And the crazy thing is, there may be method, and even a certain genius, in what otherwise looks like Mr. Trump's self-immolating madness.</p><p>His constant battles within the GOP are part of his popularity - at least for many conservative voters. He has to know that winning the election is going to be a stretch - but if he plays his cards right, he and his movement/cult of personality can cement their control of the party. That's because, as the size and passion of his rallies demonstrate, Mr. Trump is more popular with Republican voters than any other Republican. And in politics, popularity is the coin of the realm. He may not have the Republican establishment on his side, but he apparently has a lot of their voters. That may be because a lot of long-time Republican voters, possibly even the majority, don't like the current Republican Party.</p><p>On Wednesday, Fox News host Sean Hannity was channelling those people when he laid Mr. Trump's calamitous week not at the feet of its author, Mr. Trump, but instead blamed the Republican establishment.</p><p>'If in 96 days Trump loses this election,' he told listeners of his radio show, 'I am pointing the finger directly at people like Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell and Lindsey Graham and John McCain.'</p><p>He described the GOP as having been 'more harsh toward Donald Trump than they've ever been in standing up to Barack Obama and his radical agenda,' and said that Mr. Trump's candidacy was necessary 'because of your ineffectiveness, because of your weakness, your spinelessness, your lack of vision, your inability to fight Obama .... I'm getting a little sick and tired of all of you. I am, honestly, I am tempted to just say, I don't support any of you people, ever.'</p><p>To readers not resident within the Trumpian headspace or the Tea Party universe, it sounds certifiably nuts. Yet Mr. Hannity's words reflect the views of many of his viewers and listeners. As far as they're concerned, when the Messiah finally showed up, instead of welcoming him, the Republican establishment betrayed him. If Mr. Trump loses the election, he and his supporters will peddle a stab-in-the-back myth. They'll say the GOP went full Judas on their boy.</p><p>Donald Trump may be leading the GOP into its worst defeat in since Barry Goldwater in 1964. He may cost it control of the Senate and the House, handing all three branches of government to the Democrats. Then again, win or lose, he and his followers have one eye on the job of purging the GOP of moderates, intellectuals and the old guard, thereby remaking the party in his image: meaner, cruder, angrier - and dangerously unstable.</p>, <p>In early April it appeared the Canadian government might be able to pull off a dual Middle East strategy, combining co-operation with the conservative Gulf Arab states on security matters and sweeping support for current Israeli policies. John Baird, the foreign minister, had reason to be confident during the initial segments of his Middle East trek that month. There is no reason to doubt his assertion that Israeli policy was never raised with him in the Arab countries he visited, such is the Gulf leaders' overwhelming preoccupation with their own security. Nor would it have had a major role in discussions in Jordan, given King Abdullah's preoccupation with the challenge posed by the Muslim Brotherhood, the burden of Syrian refugees and the Kingdom's economic situation.</p><p>As Mr. Baird entered Israel, the score seemed 10 for the government, nil for the skeptics. To maintain that score, the minister would have been best to limit himself to established rhetoric and practice. The Arabs might have swallowed hard but they had seemingly learned to live with such policies. Had Mr. Baird chosen to go even further with a phrase or two cautioning Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu with respect to settlements in the West Bank, as did President Barack Obama during his May visit to Israel, he could have emerged from the region well satisfied.</p><p>At some point, however, the minister decided to strike out beyond the anticipated. He met the Israeli cabinet minister Tzipi Livni in Arab East Jerusalem, which is in Palestinian eyes the capital of their future state. Such a simple meeting may on the surface have appeared innocent, although there seem to have been outside players who tried to warn the minister off. But such an encounter crossed a critical red line in the competing narratives of Arabs and Israelis.</p><p>While Qatar and others were prepared to overlook their concerns about Canada more generally, Mr. Baird's Jerusalem gesture went too far. It challenged a well-established status quo, whereby foreign dignitaries do not visit the Arab part of the city to conduct business with Israelis.</p><p>As the location of the third holiest site in Islam, under Muslim rule for longer than Anglo-Saxons have been in Britain and the place from which Mohammed by tradition ascended into heaven, East Jerusalem goes to the core of the Arab cultural and religious narrative regardless of sect. There is a widespread fear that symbolic moves, seemingly innocent in themselves, will gradually facilitate Israel's absorption of this sacred space, divesting Arab Muslims of respect and dignity. They see such seemingly innocuous steps as part and parcel of a broader policy involving discriminatory zoning and planning, demolitions, evictions and archeological excavations.</p><p>Such accusations may or may not unfairly pillory Israelis, but what matters here is that they reflect deeply held beliefs. That is why Canadian governments have traditionally taken what has been called a 'fair-minded' approach to such matters: concern, a willingness to use our good offices and sensitivity to the claims and needs of both sides. Historically when we have departed from such a path, there have been repercussions: in 1979 when Joe Clark, as leader of the opposition and then as Prime Minister, promised to move the Canadian Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to (albeit Jewish West) Jerusalem, Arab reaction was swift and negative. In their minds the move was aimed at legitimizing Israel's claim to the city in its entirety. Mr. Clark appointed his much-respected predecessor as leader of the Conservative party, Robert Stanfield, to rethink the matter. Former prime minister Brian Mulroney, an admiring friend of Israel, watched language and gestures carefully, with Mr. Clark's miscalculation much in mind.</p><p>The current government has proven itself to be a much more assertive advocate of Israeli policies and practices. The Arabs have disliked Canada for it. They had generally held their fire, the not unimportant exception being their part in derailing our bid for a seat on the United Nations Security Council. That done, and in the process of establishing new Arab relationships, Canada, intentionally or not, has set off the tripwire once again, undervaluing narrative and emotion and the inferred insult such a step suggests when Arab honour is at stake.</p><p>The Qataris, after consultations with and the concurrence of other Arab governments, decided to undercut us again through their bid to see the International Civil Aviation Organization moved from Montreal to Doha. That the Qatari decision seemed sudden should not delude us that it is not serious. There will now be a struggle for votes with money on their side and organizational and operational logic on ours.</p><p>Reasoned judgment respecting the operation and integrity of UN-based institutions will probably prevail, but in this world of power and politics nothing is certain.</p><p>Michael Bell is a former Ambassador of Canada to Israel, Egypt, Jordan and the Palestinian territories.

He served as Canada's ambassador to Jordan, Egypt and Israel.</p><p>Crude violence has become Jerusalem's leitmotif within the space of days: Palestinian terrorists running down Israelis in the streets, a bus driver's possible lynching and, most shockingly, Tuesday's slaughter at the Kehilot Bnei Torah synagogue. These atrocities reflect an explosive, chaotic situation in this sacred city, where there seems to be no solution, barring a far-reaching but seemingly impossible peace agreement.</p><p>As it stands, accusations and counteraccusations run unchecked. Naftali Bennett, head of the ultranationalist Jewish Home party, accused Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas of complicity, if not active participation, in the violence. (The president added fuel to the fire by sending a message of sympathy to the family of one Palestinian perpetrator who died in a shootout.) But while Mr. Abbas may be ineffective, the depth of the Palestinian Authority's anti-terrorist co-operation with Israel puts the lie to the notion of his complicity - this is emotional and overheated rhetoric, a trait political leaders of all stripes seem almost inevitably drawn to.</p><p>There is no doubt that Israeli security authorities will clamp down further on Palestinians' freedoms, especially those of Israeli Arabs, because they can move and organize to disrupt Israeli life more easily than those in the West Bank and Gaza. The degree of this clampdown - and how successful it will be - remains to be determined. Yoram Cohen, director of Israel's Shin Bet security agency, testified before the Knesset, in seeming contradiction to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, that the perpetrators of the synagogue massacre had never been judged security risks and were not connected to any political organization. The West Bank, Jerusalem and Israeli Arab society are nevertheless penetrated by Hamas, the militant group whose frustrations, language and actions have helped create this volcanic environment.</p><p>Whatever the case, what choice do the Israelis have but to clamp down? No government can accept that its citizens be massacred. The Israeli challenge is to permanently control a situation where Palestinians feel, rightly or wrongly, that they are increasingly deprived of basic human rights in what seems like a one-state solution, a greater Israel, that excludes them from any pretense of participation.</p><p>Having lived in Israel for nine years on three separate occasions between 1975 and 2003, and having visited many times since, I must confess that I don't know the answer. If there is one, it consists of two viable states, Israel and Palestine, along the lines of the recently abandoned John Kerry initiative, the exact contents of which the U.S. administration will not discuss publicly. Neither side will settle for less than what they see as their dignity.</p><p>Differing cultures, identities, ideologies, customs, images and ethnicities seem bred in the bone here, propagating exclusivity coupled with a consequent and enduring distrust of the other. The synagogue massacre is only the most recent manifestation of the evil effects of such mindsets, demonstrating yet more clearly that the two sides cannot live together with any semblance of normalcy. Israeli practices cannot be exempted from this conundrum, nor can be the decades-long refusal of many Palestinians to accept the legitimacy of the Jewish state, whatever its boundaries. But greater Israel is a breeding ground for terror.</p><p>Nothing is more sensitive than the holy sites of Jerusalem, to which both sides attach their very being. Exclusive control of the Old City by one or the other is anathema to the other. It would violate what each sees as its sacred trust.</p><p>Rightly or wrongly, the Palestinians live in fear that Israeli ultranationalists will erode the longstanding modus vivendi of Muslim control over prayer on the Haram al-Sharif, known to Israelis as the Temple Mount. Having seen what they view as their homeland, including East Jerusalem, increasingly subject to land confiscation, housing demolition and Israeli settlement growth, Palestinians now live in an atmosphere of fear and distrust respecting the holy sites.</p><p>With the growth of the religious right in Israel, tensions are high and sensitivities extreme. Ultrareligious Jews are seen as eroding the sanctity of the control Muslims now have. Messianic militants, led by Yehuda Glick, demand that both Jews and Muslims have equal prayer rights, which would effectively end the status quo established in 1967 - a development Muslims would view, rightly or wrongly, as their final humiliation. Despite his own accusations about Palestinian culpability in the violence, Mr. Netanyahu has reiterated commitment to the status quo.</p><p>In this chaotic situation, the question is whether Mr. Netanyahu can rein in the violence, let alone the embattled Mr. Abbas. I doubt it - instead, we may be in for more bloodshed.</p>, <p>Are you ready for the revolution?</p><p>There is a reason Justin Trudeau received rock-star treatment in Davos, where the rich and brainy gathered at the World Economic Forum to talk about all that ails this planet. Mr. Trudeau speaks the language of the future but, unlike many of the others who gathered in the Swiss Alps last month to discuss humankind's greatest problems, he's in a position to do something about it. And he will.</p><p>There's not a file on Mr. Trudeau's desk more important than climate change. And a generation of Canadians is relieved that, finally, someone in Ottawa is prepared to do something about the issue. When it came to fossil fuels, Stephen Harper's philosophy was: Burn, baby, burn. Not so his young successor; nor the coterie of eco-warriors with whom he's surrounded himself. (Top adviser Gerald Butts was head of World Wildlife Fund Canada not that long ago.)</p><p>If Mr. Trudeau can't make meaningful moves on the climate file, no one can. At the moment, his popularity is as high as ever. And he will use some of that political capital to usher in the most substantive measures the nation has yet known to combat rising greenhouse gas emissions. This is a subject you'll be hearing him talk a lot about it in the next while.</p><p>While not announced officially, Mr. Trudeau will convene a first ministers meeting in Vancouver in the first week of March to discuss a national climate strategy. This is a follow-up to the non-binding commitments made by Canada in Paris last December, where Environment Minister Catherine McKenna endorsed a call to hold global warming to no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels. (This was bolder than the U.S., which has maintained a 2 C target).</p><p>While in Vancouver, Mr. Trudeau will give a keynote speech at the Globe 2016 conference on sustainability, which will be taking place at the same time. This is no accident. Vancouver is a favourite rendezvous for gatherings of the enlightened; it embodies what many believe the future will look like - bike lanes rivalling roadways, electricity supplied by low-carbon generators. Mr. Trudeau would love to Vancouverize the entire country if he could. Meantime, he'll have to make do with seeking input from those key players in Mayor Gregor Robertson's office who have helped make the city the eco-dream it's becoming.</p><p>Before all that happens, there will be a February TED conference in Vancouver, billed as a week to 'stare hard at humanity's toughest challenges.' There is a heavy push being made to get global philanthropist Bill Gates to come and talk about the Breakthrough Energy Coalition he is part of with a group of like-minded billionaires. The coalition has committed $2-billion to fund early-stage, clean-energy companies. What it is hoping for is a moon shot - that single revelation that solves the climate change predicament.</p><p>Mr. Trudeau has been so impressed by Mr. Gates' idea that he has asked his staff to investigate the idea of Canada joining in to help fund research that might one day find a solution for this planetary scourge.</p><p>In March, the Prime Minister will visit the White House. Again, the agenda will be dominated by climate.</p><p>By summer, it should be evident to all that the Liberal government is not going to be content to merely talk a good game on climate, but it will take action too. The billions of dollars it will soon commit nationally to transit-related infrastructure is part of this.</p><p>Mr. Trudeau's ambitions will not be realized without some fights. By the first ministers meeting next month, for instance, the provinces will not likely have agreed to a national price on carbon. The Prime Minister's Office is getting major push-back from some provinces, including British Columbia, which has had a modest carbon tax in place for some time and feels it has done its part.</p><p>Mr. Trudeau has been heartened by the radical environmental transformation that Rachel Notley is bringing to Alberta, of all places. If it can happen there, it can happen anywhere. If the provinces don't want to play along, however, Mr. Trudeau will have to take the gloves off. There is already talk of imposing a national carbon tax if that's what it takes.</p><p>Don't think he's serious? Just watch him.</p>, <p>That Conservative Leader Stephen Harper dislikes the media is well known.</p><p>Perhaps less well known, except to hard-core Conservative supporters, is how his party beats up on the press to raise money and how successful this appeal has been.</p><p>For example, before the Aug. 6 leaders' debate, the party sent a letter to its supporters urging contributions. 'Why?' asked party president John Walsh in the letter. 'Because already you're seeing the professional Harper critics and left-wing press pundits striving to pre-dispose public opinion and shape the post-debate public reaction their way - long before the first word is spoken!'</p><p>Phrases such as the 'chattering class' and 'anti-Conservative media bubble' and 'media pundits on the left' adorn the letter. But Mr. Walsh likes variations on the theme of 'liberal media,' as in the 'liberal media filter' and 'liberals in the Canadian media,' people presumably working assiduously and deliberately to 'risk Canada's future to the left, far left or extreme left zealots.'</p><p>To help the beleaguered Mr. Harper withstand these media assaults, Mr. Walsh urged recipients of the letter not just to send money to the party but to write letters to the editor, and to post comments on Facebook and Twitter to 'balance out the biased opinion columnists who oppose a Conservative Majority Government.' Please send a special $100 (or more) donation, Mr. Walsh said, to help launch a 'pro Conservative media blitz immediately after the debate,' because Conservatives cannot allow opponents to 'dominate the airwaves.'</p><p>Speaking of dominating the airwaves, which party spent hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars advertising its policies such as those loosely associated with the Economic Action Plan? Which one began before the election campaign a radio and television campaign denigrating Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau? And which party called an early election so that it could spend more money than the others, especially during the final week of the campaign with an unprecedented media buy?</p><p>All these efforts were from Mr. Walsh's party, but to read his letter the untutored might believe the Conservatives are indeed being outspent by their opponents. Worse, they are being done in by 'liberal media' whose tentacles have wrapped themselves around the country's collective brain and warped it against the Conservatives.</p><p>All is fair, one might say, in love, war and elections, so this sort of Walshian hyperbole might be expected. As, perhaps, also might be the photographs in the letter of Mr. Harper smiling, NDP Leader Thomas Mulcair looking like the devil possessed and Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau sporting a moustache and looking like a cross between Zorro and Lothario.</p><p>New Democrats and Liberals send messages to their supporters warning about Mr. Harper, even demonizing him, and of course rounding on his government's policies. They, too, entreat their supporters to send more money because, contrary to Conservative claims of being outspent, they know the Conservatives do indeed have more money.</p><p>What differentiates the Conservative appeals is not attacking the other parties and warning of their nefarious policies, but the idea that there are other institutions, elitist ones such as the 'liberal media,' that are out to undermine the Conservative Party and conservatism. The fight is therefore not merely partisan politics, but against wider forces.</p><p>Of course, political parties have been known to spar with, and even dislike, the media. Liberals under prime minister Pierre Trudeau thought their party got a raw deal, especially after all but two newspapers in English-speaking Canada endorsed the Conservatives in the 1980 election - which the Liberals then won.</p><p>New Democrats historically considered the media hostile, owned by capitalists who decried socialism of every hue. Take The Toronto Star, a defiantly Liberal newspaper, out of the picture, and it's hard to see a print media conspiracy against the Conservatives. But that's the way they see the world, facts notwithstanding.</p><p>As for private television, it's difficult to discern any pro- or anti-Conservative bias in a systematic way, although as everyone in the media knows, bias is often in the eye of the beholder. AM radio is overwhelmingly conservative, as any consumer of open-line shows knows. As for social media, from which many younger people now get their information, it's all over the map politically speaking.</p><p>But conjuring up the enemy of the 'liberal media' has worked for the Harper Conservatives, so to that well they return.</p>, <p>Derek H. Burney was Canada's ambassador to the U.S. from 1989-1993. Fen Osler Hampson is a distinguished fellow and director of Global Security at the Centre for International Governance Innovation and a Chancellor's Professor at Carleton University. They are the authors of Brave New Canada: Meeting the Challenge of a Changing World.</p><p>The world is highly volatile and Canada's prime-minister-designate will quickly confront a series of challenges to our national interests. As the harsh global realities and potentially combustible situations assert centre stage, nostalgic sentiments about peacekeeping and United Nations-centred multilateralism will not provide much of a prescription for relevance or effect.</p><p>As Henry Kissinger pointed out last week in The Wall Street Journal, the geopolitical order of the past 40 years is in shambles. Following his essentially unchallenged dismemberment of Ukraine, Russian President Vladimir Putin is now, for the first time, engaging militarily in a political and security vacuum in the Middle East. He intends to become the regional kingmaker, supplanting the United States. Mr. Kissinger rightly says that Islamic State now poses the greatest immediate threat to stability, and its destruction 'is more urgent than the overthrow of Bashar al-Assad, who has already lost over half of the area he once controlled.'</p><p>But the U.S.-led coalition effort against IS is in disarray. Prime-minister-designate Justin Trudeau has signalled a 'responsible' withdrawal from the combat mission against IS, and given the meagre results of the mission to date, that may not be too difficult to finesse. But it will do little to eradicate the terrorist menace. Along with the cancellation of Canada's participation in the Joint Strike Fighter program, this recall will not sit well in Washington, and will not square with Mr. Trudeau's statements that Canada seeks deeper and closer relations with the U.S.</p><p>Mr. Trudeau's formal debut on the world stage will come at the G20 Leaders Summit in Turkey on Nov. 15. He will get a first-hand glimpse at the refugee crisis that is engulfing and threatening to destabilize the social and political fabric of Europe. That gathering will be followed in rapid succession by the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meetings in Manila Nov. 18-19.</p><p>Mr. Trudeau will then head to Paris for the UN climate change conference that begins Nov. 30. He promised that he would convene a First Ministers meeting to iron out Canada's position before Paris, but time is short, and forging a national consensus on meaningful carbon reductions is a tall order. Canada should not repeat the mistake it made at the Kyoto climate summit many years ago, which was to agree to hastily improvised targets without calculating the costs or consequences of implementation. Given the fragile state of the Canadian economy and the weak price of oil, which the International Energy Agency forecasts will remain low throughout 2016, Mr. Trudeau will also have to act prudently.</p><p>But it is the bilateral agenda with Washington that will be Mr. Trudeau's most immediate challenge. High on the list is the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement, signed by the outgoing Harper government; Mr. Trudeau will now be privy to the details. He will have to decide sooner rather than later that this is an agreement that he is prepared to endorse. If ratified - an open question in Washington - it will supersede NAFTA, and there is no going back.</p><p>Mr. Trudeau also confronts a list of thorny, bilateral irritants - U.S. restrictions on Canadian beef and on softwood lumber (the latest accord expired on Oct. 12), and Buy American provisions that discriminate against Canadian manufacturers. His challenge is not simply to change the tone of Ottawa's dealings with Washington, but also to get Washington to change its own behaviour. If, as expected, Mr. Obama vetoes the Keystone XL pipeline, which Mr. Trudeau openly supports, that will become his problem. He would be wise to counter such a veto with a full endorsement of the Energy East pipeline that would at least give our oil exports more than a single, discount market. Americans understand leverage more than sentiment.</p><p>The prime-minister-designate would be well advised to initiate a strategic outreach to China in part to achieve a similar objective.</p><p>On the campaign trail, Mr. Trudeau was a stunning success. But his energy, determination, sunny disposition and skills as a boxer will be even more in demand now. Foreign policy is a contact sport, and one that requires a clear strategy to win. As Sugar Ray Leonard once said, 'I was painfully initiated into boxing, because the guys I fought were a lot bigger than me.' Welcome to the global ring, Mr. Trudeau, and, above all, don't lead with your chin.</p>, <p>Naila Keleta-Mae is a professor at the University of Waterloo where she researches race, gender, theatre and performance.</p><p>Some people are livid that Black Lives Matter staged a 30 minute sit-in at Pride Toronto's marquee parade on Sunday afternoon.</p><p>Pride Toronto is the status quo in terms of representations of lesbian, gay, bisexual, queer and transgender communities in Toronto and the front-line activism that organizations like Black Lives Matter engage in isn't intended to comfort or reaffirm the status quo.</p><p>The undercurrent of much of the anger and frustration about Black Lives Matter's latest action is the perceived audacity of the membership to use the platform of their Honour Group status at Pride Toronto to publicly and dramatically critique Pride Toronto.</p><p>But when we think that any of our institutions - from LGBTQ organizations to police forces - are beyond scrutiny and public reproach then history tells us we have entered dangerous territory.</p><p>Canada has a violent history that is fraught with painful examples of what can happen when large institutions go unchecked; even well-meaning ones that are full of good intentions.</p><p>Black Lives Matter, a grassroots chapter in Toronto of an activist movement that spans North America, is part of a long tradition of front-line activism that spans generations, cultures and issues.</p><p>The dramatic delivery of the group's activism is intended to unsettle the majority and empower minorities. In the space opened by its activism, different groups of people are emboldened and different groups of people are silenced - even if only for a moment. That is the point.</p><p>The group's demands are always lofty and its tactics are always attention-grabbing: from shutting down the Allen Expressway, to building a tent city in front of Toronto Police Services headquarters, to bringing a letter printed in large format to City Hall for city councillors to read.</p><p>Do their tactics expose already vulnerable communities to more vulnerability? Yes. Is their activism a sign of progress? Absolutely.</p><p>For some, progress looks like increased police presence, the first ever sitting Prime Minister marching in the parade, and heterosexual people at Pride wearing stickers that read 'Ally.' For some, progress looks like the list of demands that Black Lives Matter issued to Pride Toronto, things like: 'self-determination for all community spaces,' 'a commitment to increase representation amongst Pride Toronto staffing/hiring,' and 'double funding for Blockorama + ASL interpretation & headliner funding.'</p><p>For others, progress is a combination of these things. Progress is messy. Progress is fought for and fought over, especially when it takes into account the perspectives of a wide and disparate range of people.</p><p>But anger from the masses seems to be really centred on one thing: Black Lives Matter's demand for 'the removal of police floats/booths in all Pride marches/parades/community spaces.'</p><p>The irony of people rising up in 2016 to defend the police presence at Pride Toronto lies in the organization's history. When Pride Toronto started in 1981 it was as a riot against 150 police officers who raided gay bathhouses and arrested more than 300 men. The foundation of what is now known as Pride Toronto was essentially a sit-in. It was a protest. Thirty-five years later, Black Lives Matter staged a sit-in at the sit-in. They advocated within an advocacy group and that is familiar terrain for black people who have participated in social justice movements for generations across North America. There is a long history of grassroots black activists advocating for the concerns of marginalized people within mainstream efforts for equality across the continent.</p><p>Front-line activism rarely feels good for those whose lives and worldviews are interrupted or inconvenienced by public demonstrations of dissent.</p><p>But it is not the job of grassroots activists to make those who condone their marginalization and oppression to feel as though everything is fine.</p><p>Many have focused on the appropriateness and efficacy of the organization's tactics, but the real question is this: How will Pride Toronto's leadership respond?</p><p>In many ways, that is always the most important question whenever the mainstream is challenged because the response indicates the vision the organization has for itself and for the communities it represents.</p><p>For that reason, Pride Toronto's response is precisely what we should pay close attention to in the months and years to come.</p>, <p>The moment the judge issued his not-guilty verdict in the Jian Ghomeshi case last week, the wailing and gnashing of teeth began. A public opinion poll found that most Torontonians (especially women) thought he should have been convicted. Many people said their faith in the justice system had been shaken.</p><p>The case has been so polarizing that some people can't discuss it with their friends. 'I agree with the verdict but I have to keep my opinion to myself,' one woman told me. Others who spoke up have been promptly unfriended. Being outraged about the Ghomeshi case is a way of signalling your general outrage about the justice system, which, we're told, is grotesquely unfair to sexual assault victims.</p><p>All this outrage is a tribute to the #IBelieveSurvivors lobby, which has been extremely successful at spreading its message that victims are not believed, that witnesses are held to impossible standards and that men get away with it just as they always have. Its loaded language has elevated sexual assault to the level of wars and natural disasters.</p><p>Yet, according to many people who work in the system, this picture is basically untrue. The facts may surprise you. They certainly surprised me. Here is what I've learned.</p><p>1. Police almost always lay a charge when a woman complains of sexual assault, especially in Toronto and other large cities, lawyers told me. The consequences aren't trivial. The alleged abuser may be arrested. He may spend a night in jail awaiting bail. He will be forbidden to have any contact with the complainant. He may have to move out from a shared residence.</p><p>2. False allegations are not rare. 'Sadly, they happen all the time' says defence lawyer Kathryn Wells. 'It may be revenge, jealousy, payback for cheating, any number of things. Men lie, too.' In no area of life are we expected to believe some people, unconditionally. There's no reason why sexual assault should be an exception.</p><p>3. The conviction rate for sexual assault cases is relatively high. In 2013-14, the latest year reported by Statistics Canada, 3,002 cases of sexual assault were presented to courts across Canada. In many cases, charges were withdrawn or stayed (typically because the Crown did not believe there was enough evidence to convict). Of the 1,626 cases that resulted in a judicial decision, there were 1,357 guilty verdicts and 269 acquittals.</p><p>4. The range of behaviour covered by the legal term 'sexual assault' is extremely wide. It includes anything from a poke on the buttocks, to rape at knife point.</p><p>Because of the massive publicity and inflated rhetoric that surrounded the Ghomeshi case, many people are likely under the impression that the allegations were far more serious than they were. Choking, punching, slapping and hair pulling are all criminal offences, to be sure. But the alleged assaults were of short duration and did not result in injuries. When they learned the details of the allegations, several people I spoke with wondered why the case had gone to trial at all.</p><p>5. Nobody expects a victim of a violent crime to be a perfect witness. That is not the standard that is expected in court. The courts make allowance for minor errors and inconsistencies in recollection. It is also by now widely accepted that women in abusive, long-term relationships have a very hard time leaving. But the courts are not obliged to abandon common sense. If a woman says she was assaulted by a man she had just met, it is legitimate to ask why she kept pursuing him even though she claims she never wanted to see him again.</p><p>6. Alternatives to the current judicial process aren't so easy to come up with. Some people advocate a non-adversarial approach - perhaps something like a sentencing circle, which would allow an abuser to acknowledge the wrong he or she has done. That's all very well, but it only works when both parties agree to it, and when the accused person is willing to admit to what he did and knows he won't face further penalties.</p><p>It is also worth remembering that in criminal cases, there are asymmetrical consequences for complainants and defendants. If the complainant loses, life goes on. If the defendant loses, he stands to lose his liberty, his job, his reputation and much else. That's why the standard of proof is so high. In high-profile cases, a defendant is likely to lose a lot even if he wins.</p><p>7. The justice system isn't good at therapy. It can't shelter complainants from the rough-and-tumble of the adversarial process. It can't make their pain go away.</p><p>It isn't perfect. But it can, quite often, deliver justice - despite what the hashtag warriors want you to believe.</p>, <p>Only the National Capital Commission now stands between the implantation of a memorial to the victims of communism on the main ceremonial street of Ottawa and its realization.</p><p>The NCC, however, is composed largely of appointees of the Harper government. They have rolled over before; they might do so again, since the government is utterly determined for political reasons to get this monument built. Biting the hand that appointed them would take rare courage.</p><p>The NCC is obliged at least to listen to its design committee, chaired by Larry Beasley of Vancouver, once that city's brilliant chief planner. It is hard to imagine the design committee recommending either the memorial as contemplated, or the site. After all, the Royal Architectural Institute of Canada and the Ontario Association of Architects have objected to the site being used in this fashion.</p><p>Supreme Court Chief Justice Beverley McLachlin has expressed her concerns in writing, since the prime site would sit kitty-corner to her court's building and was originally intended for a new Federal Court building. Ottawa Mayor Jim Watson has objected. So have local Liberal and NDP MPs and many independent architects and planners. Seventeen past presidents of the Canadian Bar Association have also objected.</p><p>In the face of this lineup of distinguished people and institutions, the commission would have to swallow hard to approve the design. Its hands are partly tied, however, since a previous NCC board acquiesced in the change of land use for a memorial, which is what a private group proposed and is now executing with increasingly large sums of public money to supplement its own private fundraising.</p><p>Let's cut to the chase. This monument will happen, unless the government is defeated in the fall election. And even then, shovels might strike the ground before the vote, making its cancellation difficult.</p><p>The Prime Minister wants it done, period. Even if the NCC recommends against the memorial, the cabinet can overrule the NCC. And it will, despite howls from people who a) don't like the government, b) don't like the memorial, or c) both. The howls will be from the 'elites' - architects, planners, media, judges and municipal officials.</p><p>Praise will come from the intended political targets of the memorial: individuals and descendants of those who fled communist regimes, especially in Eastern Europe. Poles, Ukrainians, Czechs, Hungarians and people with lineage to the Baltic states are the target groups.</p><p>The Conservatives have worked very hard to attract these voters by other means, and the memorial represents a further tangible demonstration of the party's efforts. That the memorial has nothing central to say about Canadian history, per se, but rather of diaspora histories is irrelevant. There is political targeting going on, which could be seen in the extensive publicity given to the various announcements of the memorial's creation.</p><p>The more this government is attacked for something, the stronger its determination to proceed. We are seeing this now with the anti-terrorism legislation, Bill C-51, and we saw the same reaction last year when just about everyone in civic society, including the Chief Electoral Officer, opposed portions of suggested unilateral changes to the Fair Elections Act.</p><p>The minister who supervised that act and then stonewalled for so long was Pierre Poilievre, who, by virtue of former minister John Baird's resignation, is now the leading minister for Ottawa. Predictably, he has brushed off opposition to the memorial, saying his constituents prefer it to another downtown office building.</p>, <p>A surprising number of people have responded to the bloody slaughter in Paris by saying we shouldn't have riled them up. 'I don't condone murder,' the argument goes, 'but it's wrong to provoke people by insulting their religion.'</p><p>So, what about the slaughter of Jewish shoppers in the kosher supermarket? What did the Jews do to rile them up?</p><p>Well, some people know. Gaza, etc. Nothing justifies the slaughter of innocent civilians, of course, but Israel's atrocities are also a provocation.</p><p>In fact, for large parts of the world, Israel's very existence is a provocation. And for Islamists, killing Jews is God's work.</p><p>'As far as I am concerned, I feel I am Charlie Coulibaly,' declared Dieudonne, the anti-Semitic French comedian, on his Facebook page. He was referring to terrorist Amedy Coulibaly, who gunned down four Jews at a kosher supermarket. Dieudonne, whose appearances and videos feature long rants against Israel and the Jewish lobby, is wildly popular among young French North Africans.</p><p>Since the attacks in France, a lot of people have been warning about a backlash against Muslims that could strengthen Europe's far right and possibly create a new brand of neo-Nazi threat. But the real threat to Europe comes from the kind of angry, disaffected young Muslims who regard Dieudonne as a hero.</p><p>France's leaders are now speaking bluntly about this. Prime Minister Manuel Valls declared Saturday that France is now at war against radical Islam. 'There is a new anti-Semitism in France,' he told The Atlantic's Jeffrey Goldberg. 'We have the old anti-Semitism, and I'm obviously not downplaying it, that comes from the extreme right, but this new anti-Semitism comes from the difficult neighbourhoods, from immigrants from the Middle East and North Africa, who have turned anger about Gaza into something very dangerous. Israel and Palestine are just a pretext. There is something far more profound taking place now.'</p><p>France's Jewish population of about 500,000 is less than 1 per cent of the country's population. Yet Jews are all too often targeted by hate crimes, many of which are committed by Muslims. In 2012, seven people, including three children, were gunned down by Mohammed Merah, an anti-Semitic French citizen of Algerian extraction. Last year, four people were killed at the Jewish Museum in Belgium, allegedly by a French national. Last summer, a pro-Palestinian mob torched Jewish shops in the Paris suburb of Sarcelles. By comparison, hate crimes against Muslims are relatively minor, mostly crimes against property.</p><p>On a recent tour of synagogues in Le Marais, the old Jewish quarter of Paris, I asked some of our guides about the future for Jews in France. They were pessimistic. Thousands of Jews have left in recent years and the exodus is increasing. In the wake of the terrorist attacks, France has sent 10,000 troops to guard Jewish schools and synagogues and other sites, but they can't guard everybody all the time. And they can't change the minds of the fanatical young men who have embraced Islamic extremism. That will take a revolution within Islam itself.</p><p>'I say and repeat, again, that we are in need of a religious revolution,' Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi declared on New Year's Day. 'You imams are responsible before Allah. The entire world is waiting on you. The entire world is waiting for your word ... because the Islamic world is being torn, it is being destroyed, it is being lost. And it is being lost by our own hands.'</p><p>But even if it comes, the revolution against extremism is going to take a while. Meantime, Mr. Valls is tragically correct: We're at war.</p>, <p>The United States and its NATO allies, including Canada, are embarking on an attempt to remake the Middle East - or, rather, to unmake that which has been remade.</p><p>Wednesday night, U.S. President Barack Obama will explain to his countrymen why his country and others will attempt to defeat the Islamic State movement, which has taken over a third of Syria and a quarter of Iraq, creating a fanatical Sunni regime.</p><p>With military swiftness and a savage ideology, the Islamic State became the dominant force opposing the Syrian government, and set the Iraqi army to flight. That army, on which the North Atlantic Treaty Organization now places considerable faith, literally disappeared from the battlefield, leaving behind its modern weapons for the Islamist forces.</p><p>The Americans will now try, with the help of others, to restore the territorial integrity of both Iraq and Syria - without sending in ground troops of their own, an ambition that exceeds the chosen means.</p><p>They will count on air power and the armies of the Kurdish and Shia portions of Iraq for a military effort that must last a long time and offers very long odds of success. To this unfolding venture, Canada has already committed several dozen special-operations troops, vague promises of further help and a highly publicized (in Canada) trip to Baghdad by Foreign Minister John Baird and two opposition party critics, during which Canada pledged political fidelity and a little financial support to a deeply corrupt government in a deeply divided country.</p><p>Even if the Islamic State, formerly known as the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), is pushed back militarily, it's likely that Syria's civil war will continue to rage and Iraq will continue to be beset by political instability.</p><p>These somewhat artificial states, carved out by secret Anglo-French manipulations after the First World War, were held together by autocrats and cabals. One autocrat, Iraq's Saddam Hussein, is gone. Another, Syria's Bashar al-Assad, remains.</p><p>The Islamic State has exploited power vacuums in both countries, as well as fierce religious animosities. Outsiders barely understand these schisms, but will be expected to navigate them in the months and years ahead, now that they've plunged back into the region.</p><p>Colin Powell, who was U.S. secretary of state under president George W. Bush, once remarked (referring to Iraq) that if you break the crockery, you own it. What supporters of the 2003 invasion hoped to own was a grateful Iraqi populace and a government committed to power-sharing among Shiites, Sunnis and Kurds.</p><p>None of those hopes was realized, because Americans, as is their wont, assumed that their norms and values would be embraced by others without experience living with them. Instead, the majority Shiites, suddenly in power in Baghdad, excluded and persecuted the previously ruling Sunnis. The Kurds, seeing the weakening of the Iraqi state, reach in to grab control of territory and power they had long coveted. That they can co-exist happily now strains credulity.</p><p>Mr. Bush's administration justified that war with, among other lies, the idea that al-Qaeda had influence and exercised power in Iraq. Today, the Islamic State controls great swaths of Sunni territory in Iraq. It is more ruthless, and certainly better organized, than al-Qaeda ever was.</p><p>As Patrick Cockburn recently wrote in the London Review of Books (and as Mr. Harper, Mr. Baird and anyone else interested in the travails ahead should read): 'For America, Britain and the Western powers, the rise of ISIL and the caliphate is the ultimate disaster. Whatever they intended by their invasion of Iraq in 2003 and their efforts to get rid of Assad in Syria since 2011, it was not to see the creation of a jihadi state spanning northern Iraq and Syria run by a movement a hundred times bigger and better organized than the al-Qaeda of Osama bin Laden.'</p><p>To these complications must also be added the assorted ambitions of the Iranians, the Saudis, the Qataris and to a lesser extent the Turks, who play favourites among the factions in Syria and Iraq, and resort to duplicitousness with outsiders when it suits their purposes, which is often.</p><p>With dubious populaces at home, regional allies of uncertain commitment, evident gaps between means and ambitions, and unfocused long-term objectives, we will try to remake that which has already been remade.</p>, <p>What happens when your son tells you he's really a girl?</p><p>Twenty years ago, you probably would have crossed your fingers and tried to wait it out. Today, you might buy him a whole new wardrobe, find someone to prescribe hormone blockers, and help him live as a girl. Maybe he'll even become a celebrity. A recent Maclean's magazine cover, posing that very question, featured a lovely 11-year-old with long, flowing locks and enormous eyes. His name used to be Oliver.</p><p>Suddenly transgender kids are everywhere - in the news, on Dr. Phil and in your neighbourhood. School boards have developed detailed transgender policies. Clinics to treat transgender kids have sprung up. A condition that used to be vanishingly rare, perhaps one in 10,000 children or less, now seems common. In a random sampling of 6th- to 8th-graders in San Francisco, kids were asked if they identified as male, female or transgendered - 1.3 per cent checked off the transgendered box.</p><p>What's going on? To find out, I sat down with Dr. Ken Zucker, one of the world's foremost authorities on gender identity issues in children and adolescents. As head of the Gender Identity Service at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health in Toronto, he has worked with hundreds of kids like Olie.</p><p>'The No. 1 factor is the Internet,' he said. 'If you're struggling to find out where you fit, the Internet is filled with things about gender dysphoria.'</p><p>'When we ask, 'When did you first learn about this label of gender dysphoria', they'll say, 'Me and Mom watched Oprah,' ' adds Dr. Hayley Wood, a member of his team.</p><p>Gender dysphoria (formerly known as gender identity disorder) means being at odds with your biological sex. It's not the same as being born with ambivalent genitalia, or being gay. The popular shorthand is 'being born in the wrong body,' although that formulation probably does more harm than good. Sex-reassignment treatment is appropriate for some (although by no means all) adults who are unhappy with their gender identity, and some go on to live significantly happier lives.</p><p>But for kids, especially younger ones, the issue is much more problematic. Gender confusion is often temporary. About three-quarters of little kids who have issues with their gender - boys who want to be princesses, girls who throw their dresses in the garbage - will be comfortable with it by adolescence, according to Dr. Zucker. (Many of them will grow up to be gay or bi.) Gender confusion can also be a handy label for whatever ails a child (or her family). That's why Dr. Zucker takes a watch-and-wait approach. He even advises parents of princessy six-year-olds to say, 'You're not a girl. You're a boy.'</p><p>And in the hotly politicized world of gender politics, that makes him, in many people's eyes, a dangerous reactionary. They argue that a child's identity must be honoured, and that treatment should start sooner rather than later. They equate the watch-and-wait approach with the widely discredited practice of reparative therapy, which was a failed effort to turn gay kids straight. With the advent of powerful new drugs that delay puberty, the stakes in this debate are even higher. Start them early on puberty-blocking drugs, and their eventual transition will be easier. But which kids? What if you're pushing them on a path they don't need to go down? At what point do you start taking life-altering decisions for a child that will have enormous physical, social and emotional consequences?</p><p>Alice Dreger is a bioethicist and professor at Northwestern University's Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago. She calls herself an (im)patient advocate who prefers evidence to ideology. She is a strong supporter of transgender rights. But she thinks the pendulum has swung too far.</p><p>One reason is that social norms have dramatically changed. It is now fashionable to embrace your diverse child. Parents who encourage their kids to change gender 'are socially rewarded as wonderful and accepting,' while parents who try to take it slow 'are seen as unaccepting, lacking in affection and conservative,' she says.</p><p>These days, parents who don't like the slow-and-careful answer can shop for another one. Ms. Dreger is highly critical of what she calls the 'hasty clinics,' which are happy to help a kid transition right away. 'Parents don't like uncertainty,' she says. 'They'd rather be told, 'Here's the diagnosis, and it's all gonna turn out fine.'' Teenagers can find fast help, too. Plenty of doctors are happy to help them out with hormone treatments just for the asking.</p><p>For some people, including some adolescents, transgender treatment is lifesaving. But these treatments are neither simple nor benign. They may, among other things, retard maturation, suppress your growth or render you sterile. And in the end, medical science cannot create a body that makes you forget you were born the other sex. 'Some kids need it, but for the kids who don't, it's dangerous,' she says. 'All else being equal, it's better to avoid long-term hormone therapy and major surgery that removes a lot of tissue.'</p><p>Disturbingly, data on long-term outcomes for transgender kids are scarce. No one is tracking the evidence on puberty-blocking intervention either. 'We are doing major interventions and we have shockingly little idea what the outcomes are,' Ms. Dreger says. You get the sense that what we have is not so much a rational approach to a psychosocial issue as a radical ideological experiment.</p><p>Here's more unwelcome news from Ms. Dreger. A child's gender issue may merely be a symptom of other family problems. 'The dirty little secret is that many of these families have big dysfunctional issues. When you get the clinicians over a beer, they'll tell you the truth. A lot of the parents aren't well in terms of their mental health. They think that once the child transitions, all their problems will magically go away, but that's not really where the stress is located.' Clinicians won't say these things publicly, she says, because they don't want to sound as if they're blaming gender problems on screwed-up families.</p><p>It's a mark of social progress that we are increasingly willing to accept people on their terms, for who they are. But maybe we're manufacturing more problems than we're solving. If we really want to help people, we should remember the old rule: First, do no harm.</p>, <p>I'm not overly invested in the marijuana debate. My friends and I all smoked pot when we were young, but hardly any of us bother any more. In my circle, the drugs of choice are martinis and Chardonnay. Frankly, we consider stoners declasse.</p><p>That doesn't mean pot laws are of no concern to the upper middle class. Quite a lot of parents I know have been forced to shell out $10,000 or $15,000 to make sure their kid didn't acquire a criminal record simply for having a joint in his pocket. Less affluent kids are less likely to get off the hook, so clearly there's a social-justice issue here.</p><p>Which brings us to Justin Trudeau, who struck a bold blow for social justice this week when he declared that it's time to stop stalling and legalize pot once and for all. It's a position most Canadians agree with, so it's not bad politics. At last - a bright line in the sand between the forces of enlightened common sense, as embodied by the younger generation (Mr. Trudeau), and the forces of ignorance and repression, as embodied by out-of-touch, old white Conservatives! Is there any doubt whose side you'd rather be on?</p><p>Well, there might just be a little doubt. The battle over pot is a classic culture war, generating a lot of heat and very little light, with plenty of myth and misinformation on both sides. Legalizing marijuana wouldn't be the road to moral ruin. But it wouldn't solve all our problems either.</p><p>Like a lot of people, Mr. Trudeau seems to think that once we legalize marijuana, everything will be the same, but without arrests. In fact, he says our kids will be even safer. 'Tax it. Regulate it,' he said this week. 'It's one of the only ways to keep it out of the hands of our kids.'</p><p>Fat chance. Simple logic says he's wrong. When people want something and you make it easier to get, demand generally goes up. Especially if the price goes down. And the price of legal marijuana would go way down. It would likely be the cheapest high on a per-hour basis of all the common drugs, including beer - even if it's heavily taxed. That's because marijuana is ridiculously inexpensive to produce. It could probably be grown on a commercial basis for less than $25 a pound. That's less than 1 per cent of the current street price (about $200 an ounce in Vancouver, according to PriceofWeed.com).</p><p>I'm not trying to be snarky. I'm just pointing out the facts. On the whole, marijuana isn't very dangerous, and arresting people for possession is ludicrous. But Mr. Trudeau must be smoking something if he thinks legalizing pot would decrease consumption. Of course it wouldn't! Legalizing alcohol didn't decrease consumption either.</p><p>In fact, the evidence, such as it is, suggests that legalization would likely double or triple marijuana use. That doesn't mean we shouldn't do it. We just shouldn't kid ourselves.</p><p>It's hard to find experts who are objective about drug policy, especially in Canada, where the conversation has been hopelessly polarized between the law-and-order crowd and the legalize-everything gang (very popular in B.C.).</p><p>The most trustworthy source I've found is Mark Kleiman, professor of public policy at the UCLA School of Public Affairs and a lifelong student of drug policy. The facts I'm citing here are drawn from a valuable book he co-authored, Marijuana Legalization: What Everyone Needs to Know. Mr. Kleiman is now the newly appointed pot czar of the state of Washington, which recently voted to legalize marijuana. His job is to help Washingtonians do it well, not stupidly, and to learn as they go.</p><p>Ask Mr. Kleiman for a cost-benefit analysis of legalizing pot, and he'll say it all depends. 'Any honest assessment of the situation needs to acknowledge uncertainty,' he wrote recently. That's because, contrary to popular belief, 'there is currently no legal commercial (non-medical) production and distribution system for marijuana anywhere in the world.'</p><p>Mr. Kleiman busts some other myths held dear by legalizers. For one, the revenues from taxing pot wouldn't be all that great, because even with a big increase in demand, marijuana is not that big a business. Nor would legalization in the U.S. drive the Mexican drug cartels out of business. That's because pot doesn't account for very much of their business, maybe 20 per cent. The real money's in hard drugs. The number of young men in jail would definitely go down - especially in the United States, which has been far harsher than Canada on drug crime. But the number of young adult potheads would definitely go up.</p><p>Mr. Kleiman warns that business interests would certainly try to hijack the industry, just as they have with alcohol. He points out that in California, the medical-marijuana business is an open joke - anyone can get a prescription from certain doctors, and most of them aren't sick. Meantime, the widely touted medical benefits of cannabis are still unproven, partly because governments have blocked proper scientific testing.</p><p>There would, of course, be lots of immediate benefits to legalization. Police officers would have to find something else to do. Defence lawyers would have to turn in their Porsches. But before we rush into this, maybe we should watch and learn from the experiment in Washington.</p><p>'We have to use evidence and science to make sure we're moving forward,' Mr. Trudeau said the other day. I agree. Now if only he would follow his own advice.</p>, <p>Dr. Brian Goldman is a Toronto ER physician and author of The Secret Language of Doctors.</p><p>When I was asked to give the keynote to graduates of the class of '14, it was an honour that nevertheless filled me with terror and a bit of wistfulness.</p><p>My sense of fear in giving advice to these amazing young doctors comes from not being sure I belong in the same company. They are whip smart, talented, and ambitious beyond anything I could muster. The competition for a place in med school is past daunting; out of 3,000 wannabes, just 250 make the cut. The thought crossed my mind that if I was starting out today, I'm not at all sure I'd make the class.</p><p>The wistfulness comes from wondering whether I would want to be a member of the class of '14 if I had the opportunity. These are trying times for young doctors.</p><p>An editorial in the most recent edition of the Canadian Medical Association Journal puts the rate of burnout among residents as high as 50 per cent - with symptoms such as emotional and physical exhaustion, a detached attitude, and a belief that they can no longer work effectively with patients.</p><p>The path to burnout in these young doctors is often set years before the first symptoms appear.</p><p>The medical profession attracts bright people with personality traits like perfectionism and a martyr complex. The academic demands of being a doctor are quite high. And as these students become residents, the work demands are even higher.</p><p>Just take a trip through the hospital. The patients we treat are older, sicker and more complex. Today's residents must grasp more and do more each day than ever before. Technology fixes some problems and creates others.</p><p>To that, add sleepless nights. We all know that sleep deprivation can't be good for a resident's diagnostic acumen. A recent front-page story in The Globe and Mail documented the mixed results reducing those hours have on the well-being of residents and of their patients.</p><p>When it comes to taking care of the emotional well-being of residents (and each other), we're downright stingy.</p><p>Once students and residents have completed their last oral and written examinations, they may never receive any other feedback about their competence, let alone that that they do good work.</p><p>With nearly three decades under my belt, I can say with complete confidence that it's possible to go years without hearing anyone in authority say you're doing well.</p><p>As well, we don't do a good job helping the resident or practising physician work through and learn from the medical mistakes that are inevitable given the complexity of medicine today. Blame for failing to diagnose a heart attack - a discredited approach in other high-stakes enterprises such as commercial aviation - is still the default approach to error in medicine.</p><p>All that, plus a series of firsts that test a young doctor's ability to keep in balance emotionally. The exhilaration of a first solo birth or a first save is beyond description. Then again, there's the fallout of emotionally charged events such as the first unanticipated death and the first time you have to ask a substitute decision-maker to agree to a Do Not Attempt Resuscitation order.</p><p>Some firsts make us glad we became physicians; others make us question our choice. These young doctors will see things and may be asked to do things that put their personal moral code to the test. The experts call that moral distress, and it's considered yet another risk factor for depression and burnout - both of which lead to more errors - and the beginnings of a vicious cycle.</p><p>The human cost of burnout is almost unfathomable. Health professionals with burnout make more mistakes and their patients are at greater risk of being injured as a result of their errors. There's also a good chance the patient who is going through a traumatic event like the loss of a loved won't get emotional support because the burned out doctor doesn't have any to provide.</p><p>Even more troubling are the rates of depression that some of us feel. The number one cause of death among physicians age 35 and younger is suicide.</p><p>One may wonder how a profession as ethically grounded as doctoring has so much trouble taking care of its own. I think it's time we recognized that, collectively, we bear responsibility for the current state of affairs.</p><p>More accurately, the medical culture that fosters us is the problem. It's a culture that implies you should strive to be perfect even though you're human - one that encourages you to run from your feelings even though you can't hide from them.</p><p>There is no MRI that can peer into the doctor's emotional core. There's no clot-busting drug that can unblock the way there. But inward we must look, for the sake of those who just joined our ranks - and ours.</p><p>This is adapted from a keynote address Brian Goldman gave earlier this month to the graduating medical class at the University of Toronto.</p>, <p>It's too much to ask, apparently, that female athletes at the 2016 Olympic Games are treated like - wait for it - athletes.</p><p>Like human beings of jaw-dropping physical achievement who have made untold sacrifices to run, jump, swim, score and compete. As jocks, basically, focused on taking home gold.</p><p>Nope. From the very start, this year's Olympics coverage has been an annoying replay of every boring sexist comment ever made about women and sports.</p><p>When NBC announced last month that it would delay its stream of the opening ceremonies by an hour, outlets such as The Philadelphia Inquirer asked why. John Miller, the chief marketing officer of the channel's Games coverage, responded by saying that Olympics viewers are more likely to be women than men, and are therefore not 'particularly sports fans.'</p><p>In photos: Triumph, tears and the plain tenacity of Canada's Olympic athletes</p><p>'They're less interested in the result and more interested in the journey,' he explained. 'It's sort of like the ultimate reality show and mini-series wrapped into one.'</p><p>Things only got dumber from there.</p><p>Peter Mansbridge called Gisele Bundchen 'Mrs. Tom Brady' during CBC's opening-ceremony broadcast; clearly Uncle Canada hasn't heard that the Brazilian super model is probably worth twice as much as the football guy.</p><p>American trapshooter Cory Cogdell won her second Games medal only to have the Chicago Tribune describe her in a tweet as the 'wife of a Bears lineman,' which will never, ever happen to Bill even if Hillary wins.</p><p>'Pretty Penny' blared a Toronto Sun headline about Canada's silver butterfly medallist, lest 16-year-old Penny Oleksiak become confused that it's her speed, skill or commitment that matters in this world.</p><p>And woe be the woman who thinks she can just up and collect medals after giving birth. After American swimmer Dana Vollmer won a silver and a bronze, the Daily Mail felt the need to point out her pregnancy weight gain (it also labelled Katie Ledecky 'the female Michael Phelps').</p><p>The list goes on and the Games aren't nearly done. Even if none of this is exactly on purpose, it's not by accident either. Women playing sports has always been controversial and societies have always tried to dissuade it.</p><p>As The Globe and Mail's Cathal Kelly noted recently, Victorians got their bloomers into such a knot over ladies on teams that the late 19th-century saw soccer teams chased by mobs and rugby tournaments squashed. A hundred years or so later, Saudi Arabia prevents girls and women from playing sports inside that country, but sends foreign-trained citizens to the Games to deflect criticism.</p><p>In between has come the policing of women's hormone levels and bodies; the controversy about whether Sports Illustrated should have named the world's best tennis player, Serena Williams, or a horse as its 'sportsperson of the year' for 2015; and, oh yeah, the underpayment of female athletes at every level basically everywhere.</p><p>It's all of a piece. So yes, silly headlines and slips of the tongue do matter. And if you make a mistake, learn how to apologize, gracefully.</p><p>That's not what happened when NBC sportscaster Dan Hicks was called out for his verbiage after the women's 400-metre individual medley. After Hungarian swimmer Katinka Hosszu set a new world record, the camera panned over her husband (and coach) Shane Tusup, prompting Mr. Hicks to declare 'there's the guy responsible.' Swift derision followed on social media, so he dialled it back. A little. 'With live TV, there are often times you look back and wished you had said things differently,' Mr. Hicks said. But but but! 'It is impossible to tell Katinka's story accurately without giving appropriate credit to Shane ...'</p><p>Remind me again who's focused on emotions and relationships? Seems like it's men who are preoccupied with the juicy back story while all the sportsing is going on.</p>, <p>For the past few weeks, proven and alleged wrongdoing by several members of the Canadian Senate has preoccupied the national news media and disgusted Canadians.</p><p>But while the media focus on the Senate scandals and what to do with those responsible, the bigger long-term question is what to do with the institution itself - whether to substantially reform it or abolish it altogether.</p><p>Why do large federations with unevenly distributed populations - Australia, Germany, the United States, Canada - all have bicameral (two-house) parliaments or congresses? For solid geopolitical, historical and constitutional reasons that are as valid today as they were when these institutions were first established.</p><p>As Abraham Lincoln put it in reference to the United States: 'The convention that framed the Constitution had this difficulty: The small states wished to so frame the government that they might be equal to the larger ones regardless of the inequality of population; the larger ones insisted on equality in proportion to population. They compromised it, by basing the House of Representatives on population and the Senate on states regardless of population ...'</p><p>In Canada, of course, the same type of compromise was necessary to get the founding provinces, especially Quebec and Ontario, to agree to Confederation. But because our Senate is unelected and unaccountable to voters and taxpayers, it lacks the democratic legitimacy required to command public support for either its role as a chamber of sober second thought or its potential role as an effective champion of regional and minority interests.</p><p>Making the Senate democratically accountable through the direct or indirect election of senators is the one reform that needs to be undertaken before Canadians can fairly judge whether the institution can be made sufficiently worthy and useful to justify retention, rather than abolition.</p><p>On the political side, it is ironic that the strongest current advocate of Senate abolition in the federal arena is the Quebec-based NDP. In the long run, no province will need a reformed Senate more than Quebec, and when the federal New Democrats prematurely advocate Senate abolition, they are essentially repeating the same mistake they made in the West two decades ago.</p><p>In the 1980s and '90s, when so-called western alienation was at its peak, championing a reformed Senate to provide more effective representation of western interests was a hot and attractive topic. The Triple-E Senate movement was born out of Calgary, advocating measures to make the Senate elected, equal and effective. Senate reform became a major vote-getting plank in the Reform Party platform, Alberta passed provincial legislation to elect Senate nominees, and Stan Waters became Canada's first 'elected Senator.'</p><p>At all-candidate forums in the 1993 and 1997 elections, when western NDP candidates advocated Senate abolition, they were immediately asked: 'But how then will western interests be effectively represented in a one-house Parliament where Quebec and Ontario have an absolute majority of seats?' NDP candidates were simply unable to answer this and related questions to the satisfaction of western voters, enabling Reform, not the NDP (despite its historic roots in the West), to become the voice of western alienation and the champion of western regional interests.</p><p>Today, with the rapid growth of population in the western provinces and the shift in the country's political centre of gravity from the old Laurentian region (Quebec and Ontario together) to the new alignment between Ontario and the West, Senate reform is not as high on the western agenda as it once was. It is rather the eastern provinces, especially Quebec, with its population declining in relation to the rest of the country, that will eventually be most in need of parliamentary representation that does not rest solely on population.</p><p>In 1840, when the future Quebec and Ontario were joined by the Act of Union, Quebec had 58 per cent of the population of the United Province of Canada. By the time of Confederation in 1867, this proportion had slipped to less than 50 per cent and Sir John A. Macdonald offered equality between Ontario and Quebec in the newly created Senate to offset the dominance 'rep by pop' gave to Ontario in the newly created House of Commons.</p><p>Today, Quebec's population is 24 per cent of that of the rest of Canada and likely to decline further in percentage terms as its economy languishes under a minority separatist provincial government. Which is why Senate reform, not abolition, is in Quebec's long-run interests and the interests of all Canadians who wish to prevent 'eastern alienation' from becoming yet another strain on the unity of the country.</p><p>Preston Manning is the founder of the Manning Centre for Building Democracy.</p>, <p>Paul Heinbecker, a former ambassador to the UN, is with the Centre for International Governance Innovation, the Balsillie School and Laurier University in Waterloo</p><p>The United Kingdom's Iraq Inquiry report reminds us once again of the folly of the Iraq war and the importance of leadership. The report explodes whatever residual justification that former Prime Minister Tony Blair and his acolytes have clung to since making themselves the all too willing accomplices of the illegal U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003.</p><p>The report also reminds us of the conflict that took at least 150,000 Iraqi lives and displaced a million more, destabilizing the Middle East with the results seen today from Bagdad and Aleppo to Dhaka, Istanbul, Paris, Brussels and Orlando. It should also prompt us to contemplate what we ourselves can learn from this inquiry.</p><p>A first lesson for Canada is that foreign policy decisions, especially those involving peace and war, must be guided by values as well as interests. The report makes it clear the essential purpose of the British government going into that war in Iraq was to maintain its privileged relationship with Washington. The British went along to get along. According to the chairman of the inquiry, Sir John Chilcot, Mr. Blair wrote to President George W. Bush in July 2002 with an assurance that he would be with him 'whatever.'</p><p>The British deluded themselves that, in a partnership, they would be able to influence Washington's decisions. Mr. Chilcot's report has made it clear that, not surprisingly, the opposite happened. As Canada's Ambassador to the UN at that time, I witnessed the British play stalking horse for U.S. policy - not for the first time - and turn their own legal case on its head to align itself with Washington and justify the war. Nor, when war came, did U.K. efforts have much impact on U.S. behaviour, notably on the U.S. decision to disband the Iraq army, which lead to the creation of Islamic State.</p><p>A second lesson Canada should draw from the report is to be wary of group-think and overly confident intelligence services. According to Chilcot, 'there was an ingrained belief in the U.K. policy and intelligence communities that Iraq had retained some chemical and biological capabilities; that it was determined to preserve and if possible enhance them - and, in the future, to acquire a nuclear capability; and that it was able to conceal its activities from the UN inspectors.'</p><p>These beliefs were shared by much, though not all, of the U.S. intelligence establishment as well. The case for Iraq's having weapons of mass destruction was, in the notorious and indelible words of former CIA director George Tenet, a 'slam dunk.' U.S. Vice-President Dick Cheney said Saddam Hussein's Iraq had reconstituted its nuclear weapons. Secretary of State Colin Powell insisted to the UN Security Council that what he was presenting them were 'not assertions. [They were] facts, corroborated by many sources, some of them sources of the intelligence services of other countries.'</p><p>None of these claims about Iraq turned out to be true.</p><p>As one Arab ambassador to the UN warned at the time that, in attacking Iraq, the Americans, U.K. and allies had swallowed a razor blade that would be bloody, painful and costly to extract. Another Arab said that while the war would be won in six weeks, the crisis it would cause would last 60 years, and the Arab memory of it will last centuries.</p><p>A third lesson we should draw from the Iraq Inquiry report is the importance of the role of the UN Security Council. According to Mr. Chilcot, 'most members of the Security Council could not be convinced that peaceful options to disarm Iraq had been exhausted and that military action was therefore justified.'</p><p>I had made precisely the same observation to Ottawa at the time. In March 2003, there was no imminent threat from Saddam Hussein, a strategy of containment could have worked and UN inspections and monitoring could have continued. And if the U.S. and U.K. had endorsed rather than opposed a compromise along these lines, the Middle East would likely be a very different place than it is today.</p><p>A fourth lesson is that, with the Chilcot report on Iraq, the Butler Review of Intelligence on Weapons of Mass Destruction and other reviews, the British have manifested an appetite for accountability that is probably unmatched elsewhere. We are still awaiting the U.S. inquiry into its hell-bent march to war in Iraq, which has been the worst U.S. foreign policy mistake since Vietnam, and, in terms of lasting negative, metastatic effects, probably its worst ever.</p><p>A fifth lesson for Canada is that, especially on crucial foreign-policy decisions, it is never true that we have no choice but to support our allies. We always have a choice, if we are willing to pay the cost required by our values. And as it happened, those costs in the case of the Iraq war were entirely bearable.</p><p>Canadian politicians and officials faced a tough situation and made the right judgments for the right reasons. Both Jean Chretien and Tony Blair described their decisions on the Iraq war as the most difficult they had to make in office. Mr. Blair made the wrong decision; Mr. Chretien made the right one. Rarely in public life has sound policy been so quickly and so totally vindicated.</p>, <p>Where in the world is Rob Ford? And what is he doing? Good questions, and ones Torontonians deserve an answer to. Late last week, Mr. Ford went to Chicago, but he did not exactly arrive. As The Globe reported on Tuesday, he boarded a private jet bound for the American city, but when the plane reached its destination, the mayor 'voluntarily withdrew his application to enter the United States,' according to Roy Norton, Canada's consul general in Chicago. Mr. Norton says the mayor was 'not denied entry, per se.' But, for whatever reason, he was not at liberty to get off the plane.</p><p>So where is Mr. Ford now? We don't know. His city hall colleagues don't know. The public doesn't know. In last week's statement abruptly announcing a leave of absence he stated that 'I have a problem with alcohol' - no mention of drugs - and 'I have decided to take a leave from campaigning and from my duties as mayor to seek immediate help.' He also said that this help would be 'professional help.' Various sources told several media outlets that he was going to rehab, but that was never officially confirmed. When asked about his whereabouts late last week, the mayor's lawyer, Dennis Morris, said that it was his 'understanding' that the mayor was at rehab in Chicago. The careful phrasing was perhaps necessary, since it turns out that the mayor never made it to the Windy City.</p><p>So what is the mayor doing? Is he in some kind of a drug and alcohol abuse program? How long will he be there? The mayor's brother, Councillor Doug Ford, now says, 'He's in rehab, and that is all everyone cares about. No one in Toronto cares about where he is.' It's the usual Ford line: Trust us.</p><p>Trust is not the first thing anyone should give Mayor Ford. He has demanded it almost as often as he has betrayed it. He has a record of taking liberties with the truth, or denying it outright, and only changing his tune once irrefutable contrary evidence is presented. That describes his repeated denials and eventual admissions of various alcohol-fuelled incidents and drug use; it also covers his promises to get help for his addictions.</p><p>Last fall, after finally copping to excessive drinking and crack cocaine use - the latter explained by having been in a 'drunken stupor' - Mr. Ford said he had somehow gone cold turkey on the drinking. He 'guaranteed' that he had quit. He also claimed to be receiving unspecified medical help. But in his statement last week, the mayor seemed to be confessing to a fib, writing, 'I have tried to deal with these issues by myself over the past year. I know that I need professional help.' That would be the professional help he'd promised before.</p><p>Given that the mayor's term in office has been defined by repeated violations of public trust, and by a record of evasiveness, lying and lying about the lying, the refusal to say much of anything on what the most senior public official in the country's largest city is up to is a bit hard to swallow. Just tell Torontonians the truth.</p>, <p>The more you think about the Ontario government's secret $2.5-million payouts to three teachers' unions, the more questions come to mind. The reasoning for the payments, ostensibly made to help cover the unions' negotiating costs in the most recent round of bargaining, is full of holes.</p><p>The government claims that a new bargaining system it put in place for teachers caused the talks to go on longer than normal, incurring unexpected costs for the Ontario Secondary School Teachers' Federation, the Ontario English Catholic Teachers' Association and the Association des enseignantes et des enseignants franco-ontariens. If that is the case, let's see an accounting, down to the penny. All those zeroes in a row suggest that no accounting was done; that these were lump payouts with an invented justification.</p><p>But even if the justification weren't invented, that itself raises an important question: Why is the government covering the negotiating costs of organizations that exist to negotiate? Unions represent their members in collective bargaining, and they collect mandatory, tax-deductible union dues to do so.</p><p>Furthermore, a provincial government constantly has to negotiate dozens of union contracts. It should be able to implement bargaining systems that allow it to manage the load. If this caused talks to go slowly for teachers' unions, tough luck. Where is the compensation for the government if a teachers' union walks away from the table or uses another method to protract negotiations? Where is the compensation for families who have to find child-care alternatives when teachers go on strike? If compensation for costs were a serious issue, it wouldn't be reserved for unions alone.</p><p>So what was this money really for? You can buy the government's justification if you choose. But it's worth remembering that Ontario teachers' unions have, in fact, had some extraordinary political expenses of late.</p><p>The OSSTF spent $385,000 during the 2014 provincial election as part of a union campaign against the Progressive Conservatives. The OECTA spent $2.1-million. Both unions backed Working Families, a Liberal-supporting union coalition that through several electoral cycles has run attack ads against the provincial Tories. This was not the first election where the unions spent big to back a side. It probably won't be the last.</p>, <p>When the CBC recently unveiled its new five-year strategic plan, a document so comically Orwellian that the network should hire the consultants who wrote it to come up with a new sitcom, the elephant in the half-empty Toronto broadcasting centre went entirely unmentioned.</p><p>The plan, titled A Space For Us All, refers to the Crown corporation as CBC/Radio-Canada, as if the English- and French-language networks constitute one entity with the same audience and digital challenges. In reality, all they share is a board of directors and mandate imposed on them by the federal Broadcasting Act.</p><p>As the cuts keep coming, fans of Radio-Canada, one of the most watched public broadcasters anywhere, are starting to resent paying the price for the CBC's failure to connect with Canadians. That resentment is likely to grow as the broadcaster faces an ongoing cash crunch and slashes 1,500 more jobs by 2020.</p><p>With the loss of Hockey Night in Canada, the only CBC program to consistently deliver big ratings, advertising revenues at the English network risk sinking below those brought in by the French side, which draws millions more viewers despite operating in a much smaller market.</p><p>The last time the CBC lost hockey, during the 2012-13 NHL lockout, French and English ad sales were nearly equal. During the final quarter of 2012, the CBC's English services brought in $47.4-million, while revenues on the French side were $45-million. With hockey, the CBC's ad revenues are usually double.</p><p>In April, however, CBC President Hubert Lacroix announced the merger of the French and English advertising departments, noting that 'with the loss of hockey, the importance of self-generated revenue is even more important and strategic.' In the Lacroix jargon, the merger is part of sharing 'our vision for a Canada-wide multi-platform offering with our business partners.'</p><p>Radio-Canada supporters fear it's a money grab.</p><p>With the federal subsidy still shrinking at the hands of a hostile Conservative government, will a successful French network be subsidizing a bloated English one that fails miserably in its mandate? If that's the case, CBC/Radio-Canada needs not one strategic plan, but two.</p><p>Both the French and English networks need to deliver more content online and on smartphones, of course. But most of that content will continue to originate on the television side. Overall, Canadians watch almost 20 per cent more TV than they did a decade ago, so the medium is hardly dying.</p><p>Here, the similarities end. Radio-Canada succeeds precisely because it can be all things to all people in a market that craves local content. Quebec elites complain that the French network has gone shamelessly down-market in recent years, but the truth is that it has always had a populist bent.</p><p>It still broadcasts some of the most original and popular dramatic shows anywhere. (The top-rated Unite 9, a moody drama set in a federal women's prison, draws more than two million viewers.) The shows are mostly privately produced, but, like all Canadian-made shows, are heavily subsidized. Yet, they deliver significantly more bang for their buck than CBC dramas, which are set in Canada but stylistically American.</p><p>Radio-Canada has no such serial envy. It also finds room in its grid for weekly shows on spirituality, agriculture/environment, science and nutrition. The Charbonneau commission might never have been created without the work done by Enquete, Radio-Canada's investigative reporting show.</p><p>The network also makes abundant use of its archives with Tout le Monde en Parlait (Everyone Was Talking About It), which looks at big news events of the past. It was created on the heels of the success of Tout le Monde en Parle (Everyone Is Talking About It), the talk show that remains a Sunday-night ritual.</p><p>Of course, Radio-Canada does a fine job promoting Quebecois culture, but pays only lip service to its official mandate, which is to 'contribute to a shared national consciousness and identity.' It is overly Quebec-centric, and should be taken to task for it.</p><p>Still, Radio-Canada works. The CBC doesn't. It futilely chases ratings with American-style populist fare (wait until you see the fall lineup) while neglecting distinctive programming that English-Canadians can't get elsewhere.</p><p>The CBC should probably be half the size, embrace the PBS model and emphasize public affairs. It can never be Radio-Canada. So why gut the French network trying?</p>, <p>An 11-year-old girl has been condemned to die. A second will likely follow suit. And then how many more?</p><p>How does anyone dare to call this a victory?</p><p>On Friday, Ontario Court Justice Gethin Edward rejected the pleas of McMaster Children's Hospital to compel child-welfare authorities to intervene and force J.J., a member of the Six Nations of the Grand River community who is suffering from leukemia, to resume chemotherapy. Without the treatment, the hospital argued, she has no chance of survival; with chemo, she has a good chance of being cured.</p><p>The judge ruled that, because of her aboriginal status, J.J.'s mother D.H. has a constitutional right to refuse chemotherapy and 'pursue traditional medicine' on the child's behalf. (The family cannot be identified because of a publication ban.)</p><p>This is being hailed as a precedent-setting decision for First Nations. It may be a legal victory of sorts, an affirmation and expansion of Section 35 of the Constitution Act of 1982, which guarantees aboriginal rights, but it's a hollow one if a child will suffer and die.</p><p>What we should retain from this case - a case that never should have ended up in court - is that everyone failed to protect a child in need and, by extension, we have failed every child. (There is another eerily similar case unfolding, that of 11-year-old Makayla Sault of New Credit First Nation, but in the court of social media.)</p><p>In August, when J.J. was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, she began treatment and underwent 10 days of the planned 32-day course of chemotherapy before her parents rejected the 'Western paradigm of medicine' and declared chemo to be poison.</p><p>Indeed, chemotherapy is poison - poison that kills cancer cells. It's horrible for every child, aboriginal or otherwise. It looks like the hospital did not adequately assuage the parents' fears and could have been more culturally sensitive. When it sought to force the girl back into treatment by legal means, it set up an adversarial relationship.</p><p>But say this for McMaster Children's: They put the child first, even though they knew pursuing the case would cause them untold grief. Hopefully, they will appeal the ruling.</p><p>The child welfare agency, Brant Family and Children's Services, failed J.J. too. They decided she was not a 'child in need of protection' because she had loving parents, and tried to fob off the decision about forced treatment to others. But a child welfare agency has one job: to protect the welfare of children. Anything else is a dereliction of duty.</p><p>The court failed J.J. too, and spectacularly.</p><p>In similar cases, where parents have refused life-saving medical interventions for religious reasons (such as Jehovah's Witnesses refusing blood transfusions) or because they reject mainstream medicine for whatever reason, the courts have been quick to intervene and compel treatment.</p><p>But in this case, the court decided that the parents' aboriginal rights take precedence over the life, liberty and security of an individual child. A judge's role is often to find the proper balance between conflicting rights; in this case, the scales of justice tipped the wrong way.</p><p>Worse yet, the court afforded the parents the right to opt for 'traditional medicine' without defining that term. In fact, Judge Edward said the details of treatment (such as whether it actually works) are irrelevant; he essentially gave the parents carte blanche to do as they please. That's wrong because a child's life hangs in the balance. (And one of the more disturbing aspects of this case is that J.J.'s alternative 'treatment' has been at Florida's Hippocrates Health Institute, a 'holistic healing centre,' with a regime of massage and organic vegetables.)</p><p>There is no question that horrible abuses and injustices have been rained upon First Nations and their children, in particular - consider the residential schools and the gross overrepresentation of aboriginal children in Canada's child welfare and foster care systems.</p><p>But treating children like J.J. and Makayla for cancer - even though it evokes those horrific images of children being snatched from their parents once again - is not one of those abuses. On the contrary.</p><p>If a non-aboriginal child had been in the same situation as J.J., she would almost certainly be getting treatment now. Every child needs to be protected from blatantly unreasonable acts by their parents, even well-intentioned ones.</p><p>The affirmation of aboriginal rights should not condemn children to second-class treatment and death.</p><p>A previous version of this story incorrectly stated Section 35 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. This has been changed to Section 35 of the Constitution Act of 1982.</p>, <p>Shari Graydon is the Founder of Informed Opinions and author OMG - What if I Really AM the Best Person?, to be published next month.</p><p>------------------------</p><p>Was Justin Trudeau's promise to have women fill 50 per cent of his cabinet positions: (a) A crass play for progressive optics? (b) A lamentable abandonment of our long tradition of meritocracy? (c) Good public policy?</p><p>Congratulations if you correctly guessed (c).</p><p>In the days to come, many will analyze the merits of Mr. Trudeau's individual choices. But let's be clear about this: His decision to appoint equal numbers of male and female ministers is not only defensible, but also advisable.</p><p>The federal cabinet makes decisions that profoundly affect all Canadians, more than half of whom happen to live lives irrevocably shaped by their extra X chromosome. Public policy - on health and labour, taxation, justice - needs to reflect and accommodate their realities.</p><p>Consider Brian Mulroney's cabinet in 1989, featuring future prime minister Kim Campbell as one of only a handful of women in a cast of 40. During a discussion on access to abortion, a member of the anti-choice cohort proposed that women really ought to be educated about birth control. Ms. Campbell generously shared her considerable experience on the matter. She pointed out that many children are conceived by people who actually are practising responsible birth control. Then - too much information be damned - she described her own challenged contraceptive history. She cited a failed IUD (intrauterine device), the impracticality of the diaphragm and the reluctance of men to use condoms. Her discomfiting impromptu sex-ed class reminded many of her cabinet colleagues that they truly had no idea how to anticipate or address the needs of half the population they were elected to serve.</p><p>As for meritocracy, let's not forget that female candidates continue to face greater challenges raising money, winning nominations and being perceived as leaders through a pervasive veil of unconscious bias. When they are elected, it's important to recall the famous words of Charlotte Whitton, two-time mayor of Ottawa, who noted, 'Whatever women do they must do twice as well as men to be thought half as good.'</p><p>Selecting cabinet talent has always been balanced against the necessity of appointing ministers from different regions of the country. What is shocking, in retrospect, is that gender has, until recently, never been seen as a default category in need of consideration. How is it that previous PMs have catered to the interests of Atlantic, Prairie, Northern and Pacific Canadians, but not women?</p><p>Now, in light of the substantive body of research documenting the benefits of diversity in decision-making, there's even less justification than ever before to not strive to improve all kinds of representation.</p><p>This is not to say that the optics of a gender-balanced cabinet aren't significant. As the 2011 documentary Miss Representation points out, if you can't see her, you can't be her. High-profile, diverse women in varied careers and positions of authority allow their younger counterparts to imagine and pursue alternative futures for themselves.</p><p>Vigdis Finnbogadottir spent 16 years as president of Iceland. The length of her service meant that a generation of Icelandic kids grew up knowing only a female head of state. After announcing her retirement in 1996, she was reportedly watching television with her young grandson as the candidates to succeed her were profiled on the news. In confusion, he turned to her and said, 'But Grandmother, they can't be president - they're men!' This speaks volumes about the power of role modelling: It has the capacity to make women's leadership not only conceivable, but also inevitable. (A number of observers credited the Commander in Chief TV series, about a female president, with increasing Americans' ability to imagine a woman in the White House, giving a bump to Hillary Clinton's run in 2008.)</p><p>Similarly, research into what kinds of interventions make a difference to students who are statistically more likely to drop out of college finds that when women and members of other traditionally excluded groups receive messages such as 'You belong here,' their graduation rates increase.</p><p>Canadians are justly proud of our democracy, but the fact that women's political representation is stalled at 26 per cent at the federal level remains an embarrassment. Today's gender-balanced cabinet is a great start, but let's not stop here.</p>, <p>Canada's next chapter on going godless is gearing up for a nasty fight. It's a David versus Goliath match over a proposed law school. For now, 'David' is Trinity Western University, a Christian school funded solely by donations and unsubsidized tuition fees of its 4,000 students.</p><p>TWU is the financial and spiritual love child of thousands of evangelical Christians in Canada. The Globe and Mail Educational Survey has consistently given TWU a grade of A+ for its quality. Students and alumni of TWU range from former Members of Parliament, a former coach for the Vancouver Canucks, and many corporate, and non-profit innovators around the world. TWU's published goal is to now 'found a law school focused on law as public service, encouraging students to satisfy unmet needs for legal services and promote social justice.'</p><p>Enter Goliath: Law societies in Ontario, Nova Scotia, and the civil rights lawyer, Clayton Ruby are in court battles to shut the school down as discriminatory. The five-page belief and behavioral covenant at TWU aspires to have students limit sexual activity to the Biblical definition of marriage; 'between a man and a woman.' Mr. Ruby approached B.C.'s gay community and found a plaintiff, Mr. Trevor Loke. 'Mr. Loke had never heard of TWU, but when he heard there was a law school that was off limits to him in any meaningful way, that was an anathema, it was hateful,' Mr. Ruby told a Context TV debate.</p><p>'Let's be clear here, we are not talking about acceptance of students, we are talking about while you are in law school here we are asking you to comply with this community covenant. We are not making it a term of acceptance that you not be gay, or deny that identity,' countered Earl Phillips of TWU.</p><p>Not all lawyers agree that gay rights are being violated in this case. Not all Christians agree a true expression of Christianity is being extended in this case. But at the core of this fight, this is not an argument over what kind of sex students should or shouldn't be allowed to have.</p><p>What we're really fighting over is the right to diversity. Lost in the fireworks of this case is that Canadian students choose TWU and its Covenant because it reflects their identity. Mr. Ruby's and the law societies' fight imply that such identity can't be trusted in their definitions of public life.</p><p>'Within the confines of religion, the most inane nonsense can be believed and practiced and passed on to one's children. That's freedom of religion, have a nice time. But when you go to the government and say I want your approval for this, I want tax status for this, then it's beyond mere freedom of religion, there has to be a primacy for the right to equality,' Mr. Ruby said.</p><p>Also a human rights lawyer, Mr. Phillips left taking Charter law cases as a partner with McCarthy Tetrault to become Executive Director of TWU's proposed law school. That is, if the school should ever be allowed to exist.</p><p>'Am I allowed as a Christian to state my beliefs, to live by them and fully participate in society? Is the humanist allowed to state his opinions and beliefs, and fully participate in society? We will not necessarily come to agreement when we discuss these things. A truly pluralist diverse society understands there are differences, allows for room for those differences, allows room for peaceable and respectful discussion and allows for the fact that we may still end up in disagreement. And yet we live and work together peaceably in this country. That is what I think we mean by respect,' said Mr. Phillips.</p><p>The most radical outcome of this case would be for the courts to decide that the two visions have to live side by side, with neither identity group able to force its morality on the other. Stretching and difficult, this is what it means to make space for authentic diversity in Canada. It's a case where Canadian civility and tolerance is on trial.</p>, <p>Why did Hong Kong reject the United States' request to arrest Edward Snowden and hold him for extradition? And why does it now appear that Russia, too, will ignore U.S. pleas to expel and return the man who leaked information about the American government's systematic monitoring of cellphone calls and Internet usage? This breakdown in international cooperation is worrisome, and so too is Mr. Snowden's failure to acknowledge that the countries prepared to give him asylum are no friends of Internet freedom and free speech.</p><p>The U.S. has an extradition treaty with Hong Kong, and numerous Americans have been sent home from the Chinese territory to face charges in their homeland. For reasons still unexplained, Hong Kong officials said a request from the U.S. to arrest and hold Mr. Snowden until his extradition was settled wasn't properly made, giving Mr. Snowden the opportunity to flee to Russia. We don't know what was wrong with an otherwise routine arrest request made, and granted, many times in the past, but we do know that Hong Kong officials linked Mr. Snowden's departure to reports that the U.S. government was spying on Hong Kong computers.</p><p>In Russia, it appeared on Monday that Mr. Snowden, who is charged with theft of U.S. government property as well as two espionage-related charges, was able to arrive unhindered. His whereabouts were unknown in the hours after landing; officials there were saying nothing on Monday morning. Russia under Vladimir Putin has been a deliberate irritant of the West, whether in Syria or Iran, and it is a safe bet that it will not come to the aid of U.S. in this matter.</p><p>As a result of Mr. Snowden's successful flight from U.S. justice, an important international convention has been compromised. The mutual aid provided between countries to return indicted criminals, whether by extradition treaty or not, is a critical part of every country's justice system. If criminals can simply flee across a border and be assured that extradition requests will be ignored without a proper hearing, it will become more difficult for every nation to prosecute its wanted suspects.</p><p>As well, Mr. Snowden has become a pawn in the hands of governments that have little to no respect for Internet freedom and freedom of speech. China and Russia - countries where critics of the government face harassment, imprisonment and death - have already demonstrated that they are happy to use Mr. Snowden to embarrass the U.S. administration; no doubt Cuba, Ecuador or Venezuela will put him to the same use should he wind up in one of those countries.</p><p>Wherever he finds asylum, Mr. Snowden should make sure he is not critical of his host government's policies. The United States was gathering data under a dubious pretense that deserved exposure, but it was doing so in an effort to thwart terrorist attacks, and its citizens have recourse to a robust justice system and constitutional protections. Mr. Snowdon's protectors have more nefarious reasons for looking into the lives of their citizens - citizens that have few, if any, protections.</p>, <p>Women in management learn to listen for frequencies that are inaudible to male ears. When I was running a section of this newspaper, a management consultant once told me that I seemed irritable. Was irritability my leadership style?</p><p>Yes, I should have told him, I was irritated by patronizing management consultants. My very competent (male) deputy was not asked about his level of tetchiness. I doubt any man would be.</p><p>'Irritable.' 'Polarizing.' 'Brusque.' 'Bitchy.' Only one of those was aimed at me. The others were adjectives used to describe Jill Abramson, forced out of her job as executive editor of The New York Times this week. How about 'authoritarian' and 'Putin-like'? Those were the criticisms of Natalie Nougayrede, just ousted as the first female editor of the influential French newspaper Le Monde. That last criticism hurts; I'm not sure even Vladimir Putin wants to be described as 'Putin-like.'</p><p>Two pioneering women, the first in their roles, gone in the same week. Two women deemed too bossy to be bosses. Can we extrapolate from their experiences? Probably not, because two is a tiny sample size. If there were more women executives in the media, we would know - but there aren't. (Technically, Ms. Nougayrede resigned after a revolt by the newsroom journalists who chose her, but there is no doubt she walked the plank with a cutlass at her back.)</p><p>In the absence of much concrete information about Ms. Abramson's departure, rumours have been swirling - chief among them that she clashed with her boss, Arthur O. Sulzberger, and that she was annoyed (irritated, perhaps) to discover she wasn't making as much money as predecessor Bill Keller. The Times has denied these allegations, but Ken Auletta and The New Yorker have published figures that seem to back up the claim. Ms. Abramson hired a lawyer to look into the discrepancies, Mr. Auletta wrote, which stuck her bosses as 'especially combative.'</p><p>Combative: There's another loaded word. It's fine if you're a soldier, I suppose, but not a quality you want in a female executive. Consider this observation, from a story on women's failure to negotiate better salaries for themselves: 'Discrimination persists in the workplace and it isn't necessarily intentional or overt, experts on gender and negotiation say. But it can emerge when women act in ways that aren't considered sufficiently feminine, and when women advocate for themselves.' That story appeared in The New York Times, less than two months before Ms. Abramson was fired. It's too bad she can't live on irony.</p><p>Unfeminine: There's another good word to add to the box - perhaps later we can throw away the key. Women who aspire to leadership roles must be as wise and competent as their male colleagues, but on top of that, they must be genial and warm, because likeability is still the coin women are meant to spend. Managing a newsroom just makes it worse - journalists can be as ornery as cats woken in mid-nap, and they'll scratch if not petted the right way.</p><p>Perhaps this exhausting juggling act explains why there are so few women executives in newspapers: Just 10 per cent of the highest posts in Canada are held by women, according to a 2006 survey, and 23 per cent in the United States (the U.S. figure covers TV and radio, too).</p><p>Forty years after a group of heroic female employees launched a discrimination suit against The New York Times, women in newspapers still make, on average, just 83 per cent of men's wages. Back then, star Times financial reporter Eileen Shanahan discovered she was making substantially less than male reporters who were half as good. She asked for a raise, but was told she was making the union rate, 'and that's enough for her.' That's enough for her: Hard to believe the ink hasn't faded on that message after four decades.</p><p>We think sexism is dead in the newsroom and elsewhere, but just because it's harder to see doesn't mean it's not there. This is one of the themes of Vivian Smith's forthcoming book, Outsiders Still: Why Women Journalists Love - and Leave - Their Newspaper Careers. 'Look at Jill Abramson,' says Ms. Smith, a former Globe and Mail reporter. 'Let's say she was very direct. So what? Isn't that a quality you want in an editor-in-chief?'</p><p>One top editor at a Canadian paper told her, 'That's haunted me forever, that we can't be leaders and women.' Young reporters and editors told Ms. Smith that they didn't see a way to climb through the ranks that made sense, because there were so few women to show the way.</p><p>Now there are two fewer. Ms. Abramson is gone after less than three years, and Ms. Nougayrede after just a year. Two women who did not plunder the treasure chest, steer their ships onto the rocks or grow senile at the wheel. Instead, their crimes seem to exist in charting their own paths by their own rules. And that route, apparently, is too dangerous. Feel free to be irritated.</p>, <p>When it comes to trying to end long-standing conflicts, Barack Obama was off to a good start this week. He had snuffed out the last embers of the Vietnam War by ending a 50-year-old military embargo. He removed the last vestiges of dehumanizing racism from U.S. policy by signing a bill that banishes the word 'negro' from the criminal code. And, on top of that, he killed the leader of the Taliban.</p><p>Well, someone else, piloting a drone from a military base inside the United States, killed Akhtar Mansour, by firing a laser-guided missile into the Taliban chief's vehicle as it cruised down a northern Pakistan road.</p><p>But it was the President's kill. First, because he personally authorized it. By ending the life of an extremist leader who refused to enter into peace talks, he announced, he hoped that the Taliban, after pulling itself together, would come to the table.</p><p>Second, because leadership decapitations, as these strikes are known, are Mr. Obama's signature policy. The tightly geared killing of Osama bin Laden was the definitive move by a President who has generally backed away from the full-scale occupations that turned the previous decade into such a catastrophe.</p><p>That's the Obama approach: Skip the war and kill the chief bad guy, in hopes that his whole organization will collapse around him. It's an appealing strategy.</p><p>Who didn't cheer Mr. bin Laden's demise? A leadership decapitation doesn't sound so bad when its victims are men who are responsible for scores of actual, literal decapitations.</p><p>But does it work?</p><p>One reason why Mr. Obama's Taliban-termination received hardly more attention than his other acts on Monday is because people increasingly feel like it doesn't. The Taliban appointed another leader, its third. Al-Qaeda has sprung back to life. Some have likened decapitation policies to Whac-a-Mole games: Bash a bad guy, and another one springs up.</p><p>Boss-offing is not a mysterious topic: In recent years, an entire science of decapitation analysis has sprung up.</p><p>The most influential number-crunching was conducted in 2009 by Jenna Jordan, a researcher at the University of Chicago (she is now at Georgia Tech). She analyzed 298 incidents of 'leadership targeting' over six decades and looked at their impact on the organizations whose leaders were the recipients of these abrupt terminations.</p><p>Her results were far from encouraging. Her data showed that decapitation, on average, 'does not increase the likelihood of organizational collapse beyond a baseline rate of collapse for groups over time.'</p><p>In fact, the extremist groups most likely to fall apart (that is, to stop being able to commit attacks and wage war) are actually those whose leaders have not been killed: Hitting the head honcho actually seems to help groups keep fighting longer - perhaps because it rather literally injects some fresh blood into the organization.</p><p>More recent analyses have questioned these findings. Certain groups have indeed self-imploded following the untimely demise of their figurehead: Peru's Shining Path faded into irrelevance after its leader Abimael Guzman was captured; Italy's Red Brigades did not outlast its founding leaders; the capture of Abdullah Ocalan disempowered Turkey's Kurdistan Workers' Party for a decade.</p><p>In a big-data study last year, Bryan Price of the U.S. Military Academy analyzed 207 terrorist groups from 1970 to 2008, but instead of looking at their effectiveness, he examined their longevity.</p><p>He found that taking out the executives 'significantly increases the mortality rate of terrorist groups, even after controlling for other factors' - but it often takes longer than we'd like. Counterterrorism, he concluded, is a long game. He also found that the groups most likely to implode after things blow up in the head office are nationalists. Groups that see themselves as religious, he found, are more tolerant of bloodbaths at the top. Of 53 religious groups, only 19 have ended - 16 of them after their boss was wiped out. But of the 34 such terrorist groups still in existence (including al-Qaeda and the Islamic State), 20 have endured a decapitation strike.</p><p>There are other good reasons to knock off the kingpins: Inspiring morale in your troops, hurting jihadi recruitment by looking all-powerful, sowing moments of chaos that can be exploited. But there's no reason to think they'll make the fight any easier, or the world less bloody.</p>, <p>In 1985, Margaret Atwood released The Handmaid's Tale, a dystopian novel set in a future where women's reproductive freedom was brutally controlled by a group of allegedly god-fearing men. It was made into a movie, an opera and now, 30 years later, it's become real life.</p><p>I wish this were hyperbole. I would much prefer that the reproductive rights of women in the United States were not under constant and relentless bombardment by a group of men (and one woman) who would like to become that country's chief executive. It would be nice if even one of them recognized that this is the 21st century and that women in the United States have had a legal right to choose abortion for more than 40 years.</p><p>Let's just look at a tiny sample of the nuanced positions adopted by the 2016 Republican nominee candidates, which appeared to have been scripted on the wall of a cave.</p><p>Senator Marco Rubio: 'I think future generations will look back at this history of our country and call us barbarians for murdering millions of babies who we never gave them a chance to live.' Ben Carson: 'I am totally opposed to killing babies.'</p><p>Or how about Donald Trump calling Planned Parenthood an 'abortion factory,' before doing an about-face and offering meagre support for that organization, a slimy move even for a man who has a PhD in slime?</p><p>The Republican candidates have used the recent Planned Parenthood controversy to establish their bona fides as the least woman-friendly fellow on the ticket. In each case, though, the candidates - from Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal to former Texas governor Rick Perry to Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker - have for years been fighting to erode women's reproductive freedom.</p><p>All three instituted brutal legislation at the state level to restrict access to abortion (though courts have struck down some of those restrictions).</p><p>These men, who idealize the notion of a tiny and hands-off government, have no problem insisting that the government's hands perform an internal exam on a woman before she can have an abortion - a procedure, to be clear, which is her right.</p><p>The Planned Parenthood commotion is a red herring, although a convenient one for the Republicans. To recap: Over the past month, the anti-choice Center for Medical Progress has released six videos, shot surreptitiously with Planned Parenthood doctors and other officials, in which the sale of fetal tissue is discussed. There are more videos yet to be released.</p><p>Selling fetal tissue for profit is illegal under U.S. law. What is allowed is charging a certain amount to cover the costs of, say, research and shipping the tissue (which is inarguably valuable to scientists, and has been crucial in the development of vaccines and treatment of disease).</p><p>Planned Parenthood has vehemently denied any wrongdoing and calls the allegations 'outrageous and completely false.'</p><p>Its supporters point to the fact the organization helps millions of women (and men) every year, providing affordable contraception, cancer screening and other services to clients who might not be able to pay for care elsewhere.</p><p>But complexity of argument is about as useless as an ice cream umbrella in a year when every candidate is trying to claim the most self-righteous ground.</p><p>So Carly Fiorina, the lone female Republican contestant, speaks of the 'moral depravity' of Planned Parenthood, and Senator Ted Cruz calls the organization 'callous and heartless.' Jeb Bush wonders if $500-million (U.S.), the group's federal funding, isn't too much to spend on 'women's health care.' As we all know, health care is much more cheaply provided at night in dark alleys.</p><p>The Republicans have already tried unsuccessfully to cut off Planned Parenthood's federal funding. They'll try again. At least four men running for president successfully defunded the group when they were state governors.</p><p>The scandal isn't about fetal tissue (abortions provide about 3 per cent of Planned Parenthood's services and aren't publicly funded). It's that women's freedom is under threat across the United States: The National Women's Law Center has outlined the historic repression of abortion rights, with 135 new restrictions passed in 2011 and 2012 alone. Many women are now required to travel great distances or endure humiliating examinations before they can gain access to the care that is their right.</p><p>This repellent sideshow will, with luck, turn off a great portion of American voters. It's been called a 'war on women,' but it's not, really. It's a war on anyone who cares about freedom.</p>, <p>What a pity that Justin Trudeau's victory speech had to come after Jean Chretien and Bob Rae addressed the Liberals gathered in Ottawa to celebrate the end of the leadership race. The contrast was terrible.</p><p>The former prime minister embodied political experience and wisdom, and the crowd roared with laughter at his jokes. Mr. Rae, the departing interim leader of the party, exuded maturity and self-confidence. Who knows if the party would be in the same sorry state if the delegates had had the good sense to elect him leader in 2006?</p><p>Then this charming young man came on stage, looking like a student in a model Parliament, trying to fit into a suit much too large for him. He delivered in a rather flat tone a speech filled with goodwill and platitudes. It didn't help that Mr. Trudeau, at the relatively ripe age of 41, looks so much younger.</p><p>As he spoke, one couldn't help thinking about how his father would have sounded on the same podium. And of course the difference was crushing. The allure. The style. The eloquence. The culture. The steely mind. The intellectual authority that even his adversaries admired.</p><p>Yes, I know, comparisons are unfair - especially in this case, since Justin Trudeau is more his mother's son than his father's. He inherited Margaret Sinclair's sentimentality and gracious smile, her generosity and her natural ability to connect with people. He is everything his father wasn't, at least as a public persona. The problem is that, so far, there's no sign that he has what his father had - leadership and vision.</p><p>Still, this doesn't prevent his more frenetic supporters from heralding the birth of a dynasty. A few months ago, the Toronto Star excitedly pointed out that Justin's son, Xavier, was born on an 'auspicious date,' the 88th anniversary of Pierre Elliott Trudeau's birth. Xavier for prime minister in 2050?</p><p>What's certain is that Justin Trudeau is blessed with incredibly good luck. Try holding two little kids in your arms, including a rambunctious five-year-old boy, without losing your balance and looking gauche. He did, and the resulting photo was fabulous. Even his wife, who had just rushed to the stage to bring him the children, was perfectly composed and prettier than ever.</p><p>In his speech, Mr. Trudeau made a special appeal to Quebeckers, urging them to join their fellow Canadians to build a better country. It's the kind of pitch that Stephen Harper, among others, used to no avail. The new Liberal Leader wisely abstained from flirting with the soft nationalist vote by wading into murky constitutional terrain - his priority is to bring back into the Liberal fold the non-separatist voters lost to the NDP.</p><p>Now that he's finished riding on his family name, he wants to be known by his first name, for what he is. Especially in Quebec as in the West, where Pierre Trudeau left sour memories, he makes a point of distancing himself (with all due respect) from his father on some issues. Will this work?</p><p>All we know is that for now, Justin Trudeau raises no hostility in Quebec, just polite indifference. My guess, though, is that many Quebeckers may come to like him, for the simple reason that this young, non-confrontational and hard-working family man is, indeed, likeable. In an era when people are fed up with traditional politicians, Justin Trudeau's main asset is that he is the very opposite of a traditional politician.</p>, <p>Pollster Darrell Bricker and Globe columnist John Ibbitson argue in their book The Big Shift that Canada has moved west politically, economically and demographically, and left what they call 'the Laurentian elite' behind. There's no question that the country's demography is changing. But I think they're mistaken on some key points.</p><p>Mr. Bricker and Mr. Ibbitson argue that the Ottawa Press Gallery, like the Laurentian elite, 'is obsessed with the influence and importance of Quebec.' On the contrary, I think the English-speaking press gallery, like the elite, is largely oblivious to Quebec.</p><p>Only a few English-speaking reporters and columnists - or private-sector leaders - are comfortable in French, or knowledgeable about Quebec. Almost everyone else looks at Quebec as a mystery they wish would go away. I would argue that a much more prevalent attitude in a large part of the political class is: 'At least we don't have to feel guilty about not being bilingual because Quebec doesn't matter for this government.'</p><p>Mr. Bricker and Mr. Ibbitson argue, quite correctly, that the West is in, with a Prime Minister, Clerk of the Privy Council, Chief Justice of the Supreme Court and Governor of the Bank of Canada all from Western Canada. They could have added the former chief of the defence staff, not to mention the ministers of Citizenship and Immigration and Canadian Heritage. But they neglected to mention that they're all fluently bilingual. They learned French because they were ambitious, and they wanted to understand the whole country.</p><p>The same thing applies to provincial premiers. In fact, we're now in the unique situation that a majority of Canada's premiers are bilingual. Why? They're bright and want to understand the country as a whole. A former French ambassador once told me that one of the things that impressed him most about Canada is that French is the language of ambition.</p><p>At one point, the book describes Mr. Bricker's attendance at a parade of a very diverse army cadet corps, where a remarkable proportion of the cadets were non-Caucasian. I could give the same description of French and immersion classrooms across the country. Visible minority community members are actually more bilingual in English and French than English Canadians who've been in Canada for generations.</p><p>What immigrant students in immersion have told me is that learning French made them feel more Canadian. And French-language schools across the country are full of students - and staff - from the Maghreb, French-speaking Africa and Haiti. These students and teachers are a vibrant part of French-speaking communities across the country.</p><p>Mr. Bricker and Mr. Ibbitson say Quebec will be 'protecting a language that fewer Canadians or global citizens will understand.' To begin with, there are now more Canadians who speak French than ever before. And there are four million French-speaking Canadians who don't speak English. Anecdotally, in observing the children of my friends and the friends of my children, I can name young Canadians who have studied in China and learned Chinese, taught English in Japan and learned Japanese, worked on water projects in Vietnam and learned Vietnamese, spent time in Central America and learned Spanish, and visited Berlin and learned German. But they all learned the other Canadian language first.</p><p>What I sensed in the book, although it was never explicitly expressed, was a kind of relief. The message, in effect, is: 'Get with the program, we don't have to feel guilty that we never learned French, and we don't have to kiss Quebec any more. Bye-bye linguistic duality, hello cultural diversity.'</p><p>Well, we have nine million people in this country who speak French, four million of whom speak no English. Our French-speaking society is increasingly diverse in its reality and global in its attitude.</p><p>Consider some of the French-language films produced in the past few years: L'Ange de goudron (2001), about an Algerian immigrant family in Montreal; A Sunday in Kagali (2006), based on Gil Courtemanche's novel about the Rwandan genocide; Incendies (2010), based on a Wajdi Mouawad play about the horrors of a Middle Eastern civil war; Monsieur Lazhar (2011), about an Algerian refugee in Montreal; Rebelle (2012), about a Congolese child soldier; and Inch'Allah (2012), about a Canadian doctor in the Middle East. Three of these films were Canadian nominees for an Academy Award.</p><p>Consider the number of French-speaking Canadian singers who are touring Europe (Les Cowboys Fringants, Lynda Lemay) and Quebec actors who are performing in French films (Marc-Andre Grondin, Marie-Josee Croze). And consider the television industry, the publishing industry and the recording industry.</p><p>All of this isn't the product of a society of old white pensioners, or what Mr. Bricker and Mr. Ibbitson call 'Canada's version of Greece.' It's the product of a dynamic, culturally vibrant, multicultural, French-speaking society whose major city and cultural hub is as energetic and creative in its own way, in both official languages (think Rawi Hage and Arcade Fire) as Toronto and Vancouver.</p><p>This isn't a cultural dynamism that has anything to do with a Laurentian elite. English-speaking Canada can feel a sense of pride and ownership in this success - or it can write it off, turn away and ignore it.</p><p>I share Mr. Bricker and Mr. Ibbitson's enthusiasm for the changing demography in Canada, and the energy it represents. But those changes are occurring in French just as much as they are in English.</p><p>Graham Fraser is Canada's Official Languages Commissioner.</p>, <p>Something quite predictable happened when Quebec's Liberal government recently suggested increasing the number of immigrants the province accepts each year to 60,000 from the current 50,000. The blowback was immediate, the critics apoplectic, and the government's retreat expeditious.</p><p>Quebec's population is aging faster than anywhere in Canada outside the Atlantic provinces. Its work force is shrinking, creating labour shortages in some sectors. The novelty of policies aimed at getting Quebeckers to have more babies - cheap daycare and generous parental leave - has worn off. Quebec's birth rate fell for the sixth year in a row in 2015. At 1.6 births per woman of child-bearing age, it's down from a 2009 peak of 1.73, and now matches the national average.</p><p>A recent government white paper warned that maintaining immigration at the current 50,000 annual level would lead to a 'marked' decline in the working-age population between 2016 and 2031, putting a damper on economic growth and everything that flows from it. Starting at 60,000 immigrants a year, however, the work force would continue to grow well into the future.</p><p>A healthy discussion of immigration thresholds would consider these factors while reviewing the longer-term evidence. Since the adoption of the province's Bill 101 in 1977, requiring the children of immigrants to attend French-language schools, several cohorts of new Quebeckers have embraced la langue de Moliere and successfully integrated into francophone society. The proportion of Quebeckers speaking French at home remained a robust 82.5 per cent in 2011, while almost 95 per cent of all Quebeckers could speak French, according to Statistics Canada.</p><p>Yet, despite such reassuring evidence, opposition politicians showed the usual reflexes in denouncing the government for merely raising the possibility of an increase in immigration. Granted, immigration is a touchier subject in Quebec than anywhere else in Canada, given francophone Quebeckers's perception of themselves as a threatened minority within North America. As the debate about the former Parti Quebecois government's Charter of Values demonstrated in 2013, the perceived threat is not merely linguistic, but cultural and religious, as well.</p><p>Still, the opposition PQ and Coalition Avenir du Quebec didn't focus on those aspects as much as the short-term economic costs of accepting more immigrants. Curiously, this is the same argument raised by prominent Quebec economist Pierre Fortin, who also warns against an increase in immigration quotas.</p><p>But while it's true that immigrants to Quebec have initially tended to face more difficulty integrating into the work force - employer discrimination and lack of English-language skills being among the main reasons - they also tend to catch up by the five- or 10-year mark. And Quebec's new policy of choosing immigrants in line with qualifications and labour market requirements will only hasten the integration of newcomers.</p><p>Besides, immigration is the opposite of a short-term policy. It is a long-term investment in a society's future dynamism and prosperity. A community that invests in its immigrants will see its immigrants, and their descendants, invest in it. If Canada is an example of anything, it is this.</p><p>Slow or zero population growth is a recipe for decline - economic, social, cultural. Choosing this path out of the fear that more immigration might not only change the face, but the fibre, of Quebec society would be to condemn the province to increasing marginalization within Canada and the world.</p><p>As much as Quebec sometimes feels closer to Europe than to the rest of Canada, Europe would be the wrong model for Quebec on immigration policy. A quarter of all immigrants who arrived in Quebec in the decade up to 2013 subsequently left the province, some because they sensed an unwelcoming environment. Quebec needs to devote more resources not only to attracting immigrants, but to retaining them after they arrive.</p><p>So what if it means some will need to learn English (in addition to French) to successfully integrate into the workplace? That is a reality faced by most Quebeckers, whether native-born or not. Most professions these days, especially if they involve technology, require some functionality in English.</p><p>No francophone Quebecker I know considers unilingualism an asset, yet the suggestion that immigrants should learn both of Canada's official languages sparks howls of protest from the PQ and CAQ, which seek to make political hay out of Quebeckers' insecurities. It's an insult to the resourcefulness of Quebeckers who, over four centuries, have maintained their linguistic identity in the face of far bigger cultural threats than the presence of bilingual immigrants.</p><p>If anything, Quebec needs more of them.</p>, <p>How did everyone cope with the great sugar panic of '14? Did you hurl your chocolate bars overboard, hoping to borrow a few more years from the Grim Reaper? Or did you reach for a May West or a Twinkie, thinking, 'In for a penny, in for a pound cake'?</p><p>I responded to the new World Health Organization guidelines on sugar intake (optimally, only 5 per cent of your daily calories) by pointing a finger at my vanilla latte and whispering 'J'accuse.' Breakfast, it turns out, is one of the more lethal times of day, which is not something they teach you in university. When I think about the risks I've taken in life (and there have been a few), I never expected to find 'blueberry muffin' at the top of the list.</p><p>Sugar is the new Public Enemy No. 1, Al Capone in a porcelain bowl. The WHO's draft guidelines note, quite reasonably, that excess sugar consumption can mean 'an unhealthy diet, weight gain and increased risk of noncommunicable diseases.' But how little per day? Less than is contained in a can of pop. Never mind all the other sugar you consume in ready meals, condiments and cookies.</p><p>Last month, a U.S. study found that those who took a quarter or more of their daily calories in sugar tripled their risk of heart disease. An advocacy group called Action on Sugar has declared that 'sugar is the new tobacco.'</p><p>I like to think of this particular argument as reductio ad tobaccum, considering how many foodstuffs have recently been declared as dangerous as a pack of Player's. A couple of years ago, a Canadian study claimed that consuming egg yolks was as lethal as smoking, and then their natural platemate, bacon, got the same designation. Now, it's protein. A new, widely circulated study from the journal Cell Metabolism claims that middle-aged people who ate a diet high in meat and dairy substantially increased their risk of developing cancer. 'We provide convincing evidence that a high-protein diet - particularly if the proteins are derived from animals - is nearly as bad as smoking for your health,' one of the researchers, biologist Valter Longo, was quoted as saying.</p><p>You may wonder, as you scrape the cream cheese from your plate and replace it with a nice mound of parsley, if everything is as dangerous as smoking, why not just give in? What on earth are you supposed to put in your body? The information is deafening, a cacophony, and often contradictory. The best advice probably comes from Michael Pollan, author of many useful books on the politics of grub, who wrote: 'Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants.'</p><p>But that bit of quiet, sage wisdom doesn't really stand a chance when pitted against headlines like Could Your Sausage Kill You?! (Yes, Daily Mail, it could, if it were made out of steel, sharpened, and stuck in your eye.) If people are confused about nutrition, it's no wonder, considering that every few years a new lethal, payload comes barrelling down the highway: Cholesterol, trans fats, acrylamides. Is salt still bad for you? (Apparently not, according to a recent article in The Globe by Dr. John Sloan.) How about saturated fats? (Rehabilitated, I think.) In the great margarine-butter cage match, butter has wrestled its oily opponent to the ground and stands triumphant. That could all be flipped over tomorrow.</p><p>The danger is that the average person throws up her hands in despair. Let's assume we're all generally rational guardians of our families' health: Our kids are vaccinated, we get the flu shot every year and only occasionally do we succumb to the siren song of the cigarette or the Hickory Stick. We drink in moderation (for Torontonians, a useful benchmark is 'less than the mayor'). So how do we assess the various risks to our individual health when we're looking at a menu and trying to remember which will kill us sooner, the feta or the onion rings?</p><p>Here, it's useful to turn to David Spiegelhalter, the Winton Professor of the Public Understanding of Risk, at Cambridge University, who not only has the best job title in the world but also some excellent insights into this kind of decision-making. First, you divide your risk potential into acute (rock falling toward your head) and chronic (repeated abuse of BLT). As Prof. Spiegelhalter said in a TEDx lecture, 'A Spam fritter, unless you choke on it, is not going to kill you on the spot, but if you keep on stuffing them down your gob year after year, it's not going to do you any good at all.'</p><p>Similarly, public-health warnings carrying dire advice about shortened lifespans often fall on shuttered ears because people think they'd rather have pleasure now than an extra year at the end when they're 'old and dribbly.' A better way to think of health risks, he says, is to imagine your life sped up, or consumed, by poor choices - to consider that a hamburger or two cigarettes can eat a half-hour of your life. (Although, Prof. Spiegelhalter points out, so does an episode of Friends. Pick your poison.)</p><p>Would I trade a half-hour for a May West? Probably not, but I would for a steak. Or are steaks good for us again? Somebody let me know when the jury's in.</p><p>Follow me on Twitter: @lizrenzetti</p>, <p>Just when you thought the Harper Conservatives could stoop no lower with their attack ads against Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau, they discovered something even more base.</p><p>Household mailings, paid for by taxpayers, are supposed to communicate information from MPs to constituents about doings in government. Every MP, of course, puts her or his spin on things because, after all, they're politicians. But household mailings often contain straightforward information about which government office a constituent should phone, how to apply for government programs, or what this or that piece of legislation means.</p><p>But now the Conservatives have decided to use these mailings - as much as 10 per cent of the voters receive them at any one time - as nothing more than a printed negative ad against Mr. Trudeau. It's one thing for the Conservative Party to use its money to buy television airtime to demean Mr. Trudeau; it's another to use your money for the same base purposes. But as we see, the Harper attack machine does politics this way, always has and always will, because the Prime Minister - who authorizes all this stuff, after all - obviously thinks it works.</p><p>And until now, it has. But will it against Mr. Trudeau? It's too soon to tell, but what could happen is that the ads, while creating negative perceptions of Mr. Trudeau, might also reinforce them against the perpetrator, Stephen Harper. At some point, this sort of gutter messaging might strike Canadians as more revealing of the sender than the target, although it should be said that gutter messaging has demonstrably worked before - which is why the Conservative attack machine uses it.</p><p>Canadians in the main already have a negative perception of the Prime Minister. In April, EKOS Research asked 4,568 Canadians (using interactive voice response technology), 'Do you approve or disapprove of how Stephen Harper is handling his job?' By 50 per cent to 28 per cent, the response was No. That 28-per-cent score was the lowest approval rating the Prime Minister has had. It compares, for example, with 40 per cent in 2010.</p><p>The Prime Minister's approval rating was negative in every province, except Alberta - but even there the favourable responses exceeded the negative ones by only a small margin.</p><p>EKOS also asked about the direction of the country and found that, by 49 per cent to 39 per cent, people thought Canada was heading in the 'wrong direction.' Asked whether the government was heading in the 'wrong direction,' 54 per cent of respondents (against 34 per cent) said Yes.</p><p>Then, this week, along comes the Harris-Decima poll showing much more favourable responses for Mr. Trudeau than for Mr. Harper. Various polls now show the Liberals slightly ahead on party preference. In Quebec, the latest CROP poll shows the federal Liberals catapulting into first place under Mr. Trudeau, with the provincial Liberals also taking top spot under their new leader, Philippe Couillard.</p><p>Mr. Harper scores best on polls for leadership and experience - which is what you'd axiomatically expect for any prime minister in office for more than six years. On any criterion of likeability, listening or being in touch with Canadian values, his stock plummets.</p><p>Polls are only snapshots. They can change, and likely will. Certainly, the curiosity factor as the new boy on the scene plays in Mr. Trudeau's favour, just as it did, we should remember, for Michael Ignatieff when he became Liberal leader. As a new leader in the limelight, impressions of Mr. Trudeau are likely to jump around until more settled initial opinions take hold - which is precisely why the Harper Conservatives immediately launched those attack ads and household mailings.</p><p>It's comforting for those who don't like Mr. Harper to see polls confirming that he isn't very popular. But remember that the Conservative base is rock-solid. Party members think very highly of him, they're more likely to vote than supporters for the other parties, and they're very, very motivated. And keeping the core motivated is the Conservatives' abiding preoccupation.</p>, <p>Drawing parallels between Canada and the United States on criminal justice matters can be tendentious. Laws and practices differ, and so do circumstances.</p><p>But at least one aspect of the events in Ferguson, Mo., is relatable to the Canadian experience: Death often seems to be treated differently when that death is caused by a cop. Contemporary examples of the phenomenon are plentiful, and not just in the U.S.</p><p>There's been a litany of police-involved fatalities in Canada since the Braidwood inquiry probed Robert Dziekanski's entirely unnecessary death at the hands of the RCMP in 2007; the most recent to provoke an outcry cost the life of a five-year-old child in suburban Montreal.</p><p>Nicholas Thorne-Belance died last winter after the car his dad was driving was struck by an unmarked police car, travelling at 122 kilometres per hour in a 50 km/h zone. It wasn't an emergency, and the officer behind the wheel wasn't charged. Prosecutors defended their decision last week and even laid part of the blame for the crash on the child's father, citing a witness account. But that witness has since come forward to contradict the Crown's characterization. The provincial government has set up an independent investigation.</p><p>No, police officers don't always walk when someone dies in the course of their duties. Toronto officer James Forcillo faces murder charges for shooting Sammy Yatim on a streetcar in July, 2013, a case where prosecutors have the advantage of multiple witness videos. But more needs to be done to forestall a toxic perception from taking root - that once you don a police uniform different standards apply. Police officers, precisely because they are given unique powers and weapons, should if anything be held to an even higher standard.</p><p>There have been many calls for reform, and jurisdictions across Canada are grappling with various aspects of policing such as use of force, de-escalation and appropriate oversight. Part of the difficulty is institutional, with police often investigating other police, and police and prosecutors working cheek-by-jowl. But even in Ontario, which has a separate Special Investigations Unit to probe police use-of-force incidents, there often appears to be little enthusiasm for zealously prosecuting questionable police-involved deaths.</p><p>The events of Ferguson, Mo., serve as an object example of why the question - who is policing the police? - must be taken more seriously. In Canada, Quebec's new inquiry is just a start.</p>, <p>The epidemic - and there is no other word for it - of fatal drug overdoses in British Columbia beggars belief: 755 so far this year, 128 in November alone, 13 in a single day in December.</p><p>There were more deaths from fentanyl last month in B.C. than there were murders in the province last year.</p><p>If a virus were the cause of these deaths, a massive public-health response would be under way. But the health crisis in this case is one of addiction, a contentious and misunderstood disease that is viewed with suspicion instead of empathy.</p><p>And so officials in Vancouver, where the majority of the overdoses are occurring, and the B.C. government are scrambling to deal with this mind-boggling onslaught largely on their own.</p><p>The province has been flooded with toxic synthetic opioids that are deadly in low doses. Imported from China, illicit fentanyl and carfentanil have been killing addicts and recreational drug users who are unprepared for the potency of these new drugs.</p><p>Vancouver's city council has responded by raising property taxes to fund a new community policing centre, more front-line staff and a new medic unit in the Downtown Eastside, where many of the overdoses occur.</p><p>The province has declared a public-health emergency and promised more hospital beds to treat people with addictions. It has also opened new safe-injection sites where addicts can get their fix with other people around, in case they overdose.</p><p>But health officials have had to acknowledge that, at this point, they are losing the battle.</p><p>The federal government needs to bring its considerable resources to play. Ottawa has taken steps, but they have been legislative ones aimed at stopping the import of the drugs, and the equipment used to prepare them for sale, as well as removing legal roadblocks to supervised injection sites.</p><p>What is needed now is an acknowledgment by the federal government that this is not British Columbia's problem alone. This is an epidemic that will likely spread, and it needs to be contained and rolled back in the same fashion as an outbreak of a deadly disease would be.</p><p>Ottawa should go at it the same way it would deal with an epidemic spread of a deadly flu. The first step involves Health Canada reinforcing the message that drug addiction is a disease, not a crime, which would help overcome the inertia that has stalled the response to this crisis.</p><p>Prime Minister Justin Trudeau could drive that point home, and bring a lot of attention to the human side of the story, by visiting one of the new supervised injection sites. The federal and provincial governments should also be pitching in more financially: Health emergencies crossing boundaries are not a challenge that should be left to municipal taxpayers, or municipal governments. It's bigger than them.</p><p>And then once the situation in B.C. is brought under control, Ottawa has to launch something that has long been needed in Canada: an aggressive program to help people wean themselves off the opioids that are at the root of the crisis.</p><p>This is a catastrophe that was in part created innocently, and by accident, in doctor's offices. Many physicians have been over-prescribing opioids for years, inadvertently dooming patients to addiction.</p><p>Ontario, like other provinces, has begun to crack down on MDs who liberally prescribe the drugs, a response that came after more than 700 people died from opioid overdoses in the province in 2015.</p><p>It's the right move, but there's a catch.</p><p>Patients who cannot wean themselves off the drug once their prescription ends - again, it's an addiction - may well turn to the street for a replacement. That could put them in contact with illicit fentanyl in the form of counterfeit pills masquerading as the less-powerful prescription brand they are familiar with - as has happened to some users in B.C. who overdosed.</p><p>The best way to protect people from overdosing on illicit opioids is to help them get off their addictions. This will require more treatment centres and more trained personnel. Ottawa could consider leaning on the manufacturers of opioids to help cover the costs, but whatever it does, it should not do it in half-measures.</p><p>The B.C. crisis is partly about what happens when societies fail to recognize that addiction is a health issue, and instead leave it mostly up to police and courts to deal with the problem. Fentanyl addiction is literally knocking on the door of every province. A number of northern U.S. states are having their own opioid crises, and the drug is primed to flow north.</p><p>Canada can either treat this as a national issue, and stand a chance of success, or it can deal with the problem in a piecemeal fashion - one local epidemic at a time.</p>, <p>Signa Daum Shanks is a professor at Osgoode Hall Law School.

Not in the United States, and certainly not in Canada.</p><p>Using team names like 'Indians', 'Chiefs', 'Braves', 'Redskins' or 'Eskimos' is offensive: They are race-based and they should be abandoned if not prohibited. Would we really be having such a conversation if a high school football team were called the 'Northern Negroes' or if a professional sports franchise in Canada had the name 'Jasper Jewboys'? Not likely.</p><p>Using indigenous peoples as team names is the worst form of cultural appropriation. It takes an entire people and reduces them to the basest of stereotypes. If you have any doubt, simply look at Cleveland's logo, Chief Wahoo. This is no tribute to indigenous peoples: it is a cartoonish amalgamation of stereotypes that demean the dignity of real people.</p><p>In a baseball game, the umpire calls out strikes loudly for all to hear. So too should fans of the game call out racism.</p><p>Indigenous team names threaten our personal security. Yelling, 'kill the Indians!' on the street may be a precursor to a hate crime, but inside the Rogers Centre it is not only acceptable, but encouraged by some. Imagine how an indigenous person would experience being surrounded by people yelling various things, including phrases about 'those goddamn Indians' or worse.</p><p>Now change that phrase to mention whatever group you belong to and say the same phrase, or change it to say your group is 'stupid' or 'cheating'.</p><p>Why are indigenous persons expected to accept such indignities? Why do the rest of us not challenge the sports teams and the leagues for promoting such attitudes and egging racism on.</p><p>The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms protects security of the person. The Supreme Court of Canada has said this includes both physical and psychological security. And various human rights codes are supposed to ensure that discrimination is not part of public spaces, like ballparks. This country's trends in laws and political policies apply to all who are located here, including teams that originate from other countries.</p><p>The City of Cleveland cannot be faulted for not knowing about Canada's Truth and Reconciliation Commission. And Blue Jays fans who are at their worst are a concern to all and require a strong response. But we need to realize it's not a game when fan intensity, alcohol and trash-talk collide with the dignity of peoples who have been marginalized in their own country.</p><p>There is a lot of attention being paid to calls for reconciliation in this country. Reconciliation begins with respect for one another and acknowledgement that indigenous peoples are people - not cartoon mascots with cute-sounding nicknames.</p><p>Schools and leagues around the country have shown courage in changing their team names and mascots. Those that do not are on the wrong side of history.</p><p>Baseball creates employment, fosters community spirit and provides food we can't get enough of. But the recent behaviour of some fans, along with Cleveland's team name and symbols, remind us that sports can also be a place of prejudice.</p><p>We may not be able to change Cleveland's team name and logo today, but we can do our part here at home by advocating for the end of indigenous mascots on Canadian teams.</p><p>Reconciliation requires hard work. Ditching race-based indigenous sports teams' names is comparatively easy.</p><p>As we draw closer to celebrating Canada's 150th birthday, we must turn the page on this part of professional sports and create the next chapter in Canada's history, together. Go Jays! Go Canada!</p>, <p>Trace the trajectories of the Canadian and American conservative parties and you will find significant similarities. Since the 1980s, the more raw-boned elements in our Conservatives and their Republicans have each asserted control. The fallout is still being felt.</p><p>In Destiny and Power: The American Odyssey of George Herbert Walker Bush, Jon Meacham's adulatory book on the first president Bush, you get a sense of the dramatic shift on the Republican side. What a gentleman was papa George, compared with the Grand Old Party's current preachers and screechers. The Republicans have gone from a temperate lot to Tea Party hard-liners to the tumult of the Ted Cruzes and Donald Trumps.</p><p>The divisions will play out, probably brutally. A showdown between the troglodytes and the moderates is soon to happen.</p><p>The Democrats also have their divisions. Semi-socialist Bernie Sanders is the most radical challenger for the crown to come along in decades. But, unlike the insult brigade on the GOP side, the Democrats are running a dignified campaign.</p><p>It's in keeping with Barack Obama's high behavioural standards. David Brooks, the conservative sage at The New York Times, was pointing out in a recent column how Mr. Obama, unlike the Republicans, has a quality called class. He wrote of the Democrat President's 'integrity, humanity, good manners and elegance.'</p><p>The piece hardly endeared him to GOP fellow travellers. But he, like many Americans, has been appalled by the divisiveness and rancour in Republican precincts, highlighted by what The Washington Post calls 'the utter ugliness of Donald Trump's campaign.'</p><p>North of the border, Conservatives have had no shortage of experience with crass acts. Former Toronto mayor Rob Ford brought disgrace to the conservative name. Former prime minister Stephen Harper's team was noted for a long run of dirty deeds. It's the way the hard right in both countries does business. Class act isn't part of the equation.</p><p>How costly has it been? After the past election, several Tories said their cause was hurt by what they gently referred to as the 'tone' problem. By tone, they mean things such as race-baiting, enemies lists and running a closed government.</p><p>In the party now, things are calm under the measured, impressive interim leadership of Rona Ambrose. But don't be surprised when the leadership race moves into high gear to see a reckoning, a pitched battle between the hard right and moderates for control of the party.</p><p>Critical will be to see whether the Conservatives have learned from their election experience. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's leadership illustrates how important 'tone' can be. He has been riding high, not so much because of what he has done, but how he is doing it.</p><p>Writing an election post-mortem on these pages last week, Jenni Byrne, the Conservatives' campaign architect, didn't even cite the integrity issue, nor did party strategist Ken Boessenkool in an earlier appraisal. Until the past election, the party did well politically via Mr. Harper's autocratic methods. He won three of five elections, a 60-per-cent ranking. That's good, though by our historical standards not imposing, Higher winning averages were achieved by prime ministers Jean Chretien, Brian Mulroney, Pierre Trudeau, Louis St. Laurent, Mackenzie King, Robert Borden, Wilfrid Laurier and John A. Macdonald.</p><p>Ms. Byrne said it was the country's mood for change that brought on the recent defeat and expressed confidence that the party can win back power in 2019. If history is any guide, that will be a mighty tall order. New leaders who come to power in Canada with a majority almost always retain power in the following election. In the past 140 years, there has been only one exception, it being R.B. Bennett, who was felled by the Great Depression.</p><p>In the United States, the Democrats have been in power almost eight years. The time-for-change argument plays to the Republicans' favour. But if they are to win, they will have to bridge their divides, a thorny task given the presence of Mr. Trump.</p><p>On this side of the border, Conservatives have more time to sort out their divides and their future.</p>, <p>Liam Kennedy holds a PhD in sociology from the University of Toronto. He studies crime, deviance, and punishment.</p><p>As the body of former Toronto mayor Rob Ford lies in city hall for public visitation, we need to address our collective hypocrisy for how we treated the man's problems while he was alive.</p><p>In the days following Mr. Ford's admission to smoking crack cocaine, many notable politicians, members of the news media, and citizens called for him to step down or take a leave from his mayoral duties and to get help for his addiction.</p><p>At the time some regarded his behaviour as disgusting, embarrassing, and unforgivable (this is just a small sample of the pejorative adjectives employed). Mr. Ford, as we know, refused to resign and it took an additional six months and news of another crack video for him to enter a rehabilitation facility seeking treatment for his substance abuse.</p><p>In the intervening period he was mocked for his weight and lack of grace, sophistication, and overall polish. And, because he failed to follow an extremely narrow pathway to recovery set out for him, he was repeatedly condemned for his lack of contrition, humility, remorse, and honour.</p><p>Those labelled addicts, so this line of thinking goes, should be ashamed of their behaviour and the harm it has caused to those around them, should repent for their misdeeds, and should seek redemption through recovery (often treated as synonymous with a stint in a treatment facility). In the eyes of many, Rob Ford's decision not to follow this pathway rendered him subject to ridicule and shunning. For a city - and country - that prides itself on tolerance and diversity, sympathy and empathy were in remarkably short supply.</p><p>Today, his courage, determination, and dedication to the city of Toronto are being commended by prominent political figures. Former prime minister Stephen Harper referred to him as a 'fighter,' a sentiment shared by others. In other words, many of the same qualities for which he was reviled in 2013 and 2014 are being celebrated now in the wake of his death at age 46, more than a year after first being diagnosed with a rare form of cancer.</p><p>For his part, Toronto Mayor John Tory, recalled that Rob Ford was a 'profoundly human guy.' This humanity was lost far too often during the discussion of Mr. Ford's substance use. Too many of us were much too quick to moralize the issue, to attack Ford for his apparent connections to individuals involved in the drug trade, and to proclaim that his addiction could be fixed with a short stint at a Muskoka rehabilitation facility or a vacation in Florida.</p><p>Only now, after his death, do we feel sorry for him and his family? Now he is worthy of sympathy? That strikes me as pretty disingenuous. Mr. Ford's death should give us pause.</p><p>We should all take some time to acknowledge our hypocrisy, to remember our shared humanity not just when someone 'battles' cancer but when they struggle with addiction (or mental illness or poverty or discrimination or domestic violence), and to move forward with reasoned approaches to the complex issue of drug and alcohol abuse. The current debate about opening three safe injection sites in Toronto is a positive sign on this front, perhaps marking a shift from an unsuccessful law-and-order approach that criminalizes drug users and towards harm reduction.</p><p>While this discussion is a reason for optimism, let's refrain from patting ourselves on the back for our progressiveness until we start treating all individuals with substance abuse problems with compassion and understanding.</p>, <p>In the mid-1970s, when Yonge Street was a tawdry nirvana bisecting Toronto, my father used to leave my older brothers and I in a pinball arcade while he went record shopping. At night. For hours. I was young enough to need a plastic milk crate to stand on so I could reach the flippers.</p><p>He didn't entirely abandon us, in the middle of the night, on a street full of weirdos and miscreants: He made sure we had a plastic bag full of change for the games. Then he went off to Sam the Record Man or A&As to look for opera imports. Only once did anyone in authority express any concern over three raggedy children playing Fireball 5000 or whatever the hot game of the moment was. A policeman came into the arcade and asked where our parents were, and my brother flapped a hand toward the door: 'Dad's buying records.' This seemed like a reasonable answer, so the officer left us to our pinball.</p><p>Now, of course, the officer would have taken us into custody and thrown my father into jail. But it was the 1970s, and no one had a parenting philosophy beyond 'I hope they're all still alive tomorrow.' A man who chain-smoked Export As while driving his unseatbelted children in the back of the Impala did not have a finely tuned sense of danger, by today's standards. Or maybe it was perfectly well tuned, and it's the standards that have gone haywire.</p><p>The unspoken principle of benign neglect that governed the lives of children in the 1970s is now called 'free-range parenting' or 'unparenting.' This movement, which has been growing for the past half-decade, is an attempt to free children from the thumb of adult oppression, at least for brief periods, thus allowing them to grow a tough outer shell. It has a new pair of martyrs, Danielle and Alexander Meitiv of Silver Spring, Md.</p><p>This week, for the second time this year, the Meitivs are being investigated for behaviour relating to their kids, Rafi, 10, and Dvora, 6. Did they abandon their kids and go to the casino? Nope. Abuse them in some way? Make them watch Here Comes Honey Boo Boo over and over? No again. Their crime was letting their kids play in the park and walk home alone.</p><p>After a local dog-walker spotted the unsupervised children and called 911, they were picked up and kept for hours in a police cruiser and then in custody, which the kids not surprisingly found traumatic. Possibly quite a bit more traumatic than walking home together in their nice neighbourhood.</p><p>The Meitivs are repeat offenders, in the eyes of child-protection services: They'd been investigated earlier this year for letting their child run loose in the neighbourhood. In February, Danielle Meitiv defended her child-rearing principles in the Washington Post: 'Not everyone is comfortable with the idea of young children being outside without adult supervision. We're not always comfortable with it, either. We think, however, that giving them an opportunity to learn to make their way in the world independently is the best way to prepare them for adulthood - and that it is safe for them to do so.'</p><p>Kids are in danger, free-rangers argue: Not from abduction, which is a minuscule threat, but from the long-term harm that comes in never learning to do anything for themselves. Their little independence glands are atrophying and will soon be as useless as an appendix. As Ms. Meitiv wrote, 'Stranger abduction, the bogeyman of most parental fears, has always been exceedingly rare. Far more hazardous are the obesity risks and idleness we subject children to if we do not allow them to run outside and play.'</p><p>This penning of children like veal calves has happened in remarkably short order - really only a couple of decades. You could blame the privatization of public space, which imposes rules on formerly unruly common land, or the hyper-vigilance that has trained us to look for abuse and neglect in children, or just the concern of parents who have fewer children, and are more invested in each of them. Feel free to substitute 'ruinous paranoia' for 'concern' in the preceding sentence.</p><p>At least the Meitivs are embraced by a community of like-minded child-ignorers. (I joke - you really only want to ignore your children when they ask for things like car keys, or college tuition.) Chief among their supporters is Lenore Skenazy, doyenne of the free-range movement, who was excoriated in 2008 for letting her nine-year-old son ride the New York subway by himself.</p><p>I interviewed Ms. Skenazy five years ago, when I was intent on starting a free-range movement on my street - the attempt was doomed, ironically, by my inability to set enough children free. Something she said then has stuck with me ever since: 'Can you imagine a headline in the 1970s that said, 'Kids Play in Park, Experts Astounded.' '?</p><p>Or 'kids play in park, parents investigated for abuse.' The Meitivs have said they're considering a lawsuit against the authorities in Maryland. I'm sure that if my father were still around he'd donate to their cause, or at least give their kids some quarters so they could go out and play video games in an arcade, as nature intended.</p>, <p>There comes a moment in some of our lives when a dear friend will succumb to the siren song of Dr. Wrinkle-Free, the cosmetic surgeon. That friend will present herself at the door, and you can either swallow your horror and acknowledge this new wax person, or you can shriek, 'My God, Marjorie, what have you done to your face?'</p><p>I think all of Ottawa had a collective 'My God, Marjorie' moment when the proposed addition to the Chateau Laurier hotel was unveiled this week. The boxy refurbishment was less a subtle nip-and-tuck than a jarring mash-up, as if they'd stuck a nose ring on the Mona Lisa (it may be generous to compare the hotel to the Mona Lisa, but Ottawa - how to put this gently - does not exactly bristle with landmark architecture.)</p><p>Related: The Parliament buildings are getting an expensive facelift</p><p>Globe editorial: 24 Sussex Drive is your house too, and it needs to be repaired</p><p>The criticism of the planned extension was quick and, for Ottawa, brutal. 'Is this a joke?' was a common reaction online, along with the suggestion that the new addition, designed by Toronto architect Peter Clewes, had been inspired by the online game Minecraft. The hotel's copper roof and Indiana limestone are reflected in the proposed design, but not its grandeur or whimsy; the whole effect is a bit Condoland 2016. Ottawa's mayor, Jim Watson, suggested on Twitter that all parties involved 'go back to the drawing board.'</p><p>You can bet there will be drawing boards, and public consultations with 'stakeholders' - i.e., meetings with annoyed citizens drinking rancid coffee from paper cups - and eventually some kind of compromise will be met that services the twin gods of commerce and good taste. Every city that has the luck to grow and flourish experiences these tensions.</p><p>This is even more true in a country that's so young it doesn't really possess a unified architectural vernacular, and jealously guards the bits we've borrowed from other cultures. In Toronto, Daniel Libeskind's spiked glass extension to the Royal Ontario Museum still causes people to shake with rage. (I personally love its punky exuberance, but I'm in the minority.) Only 20 years ago, Moshe Safdie's Vancouver Public Library, an over-the-top wink at a Roman colosseum that won a public popularity contest, divided the hoi polloi and the architecture critics. The public loved it; critics not so much.</p><p>Buildings, and their additions, can slowly warm even the most hostile hearts: It's hard to remember that many of the places we most treasure, from Frank Lloyd Wright's Guggenheim Museum in New York to I.M. Pei's pyramid addition to the Louvre, were initially held in contempt. I'm not saying that's the case with the box they're trying to fix on the side of this hotel, only that architecture is long, and outrage is short.</p><p>The Chateau Laurier is, like other dowagers needing a touch-up, the victim of its own success. Its owners, Larco Investments, want to expand the hotel by 200 rooms, adding suites and new underground parking. There's no doubt the old girl needs to shake the Labrador hair off her skirts, but you don't want to turn her into a Kardashian overnight. There's only so much Ottawa's heart can take.</p><p>The Globe wrote approvingly about the magnificence of the Chateau Laurier when it opened on June 2, 1912, at a cost of $2-million: 'The latest word in palace hotels on this continent in point of chaste and impressive architecture, in point of beauty of interior decorations, and in point of completeness of arrangements for the comfort and convenience of guests was spoken last night. ...' The Chateau Laurier, with its palm-room, its writing-corridor and its ladies' parlours, 'has admirably succeeded in getting away from the conventional hotel-like and un-homelike stiffness of most modern hotels.'</p><p>That's a lot of history and public affection to be up against. A beloved building, even one that you pass a hundred times a month and rarely give a second thought, is like the face of that friend you take for granted until it's gone, or irrevocably changed. Then your shared story has been rewritten, and history lost, and no one even asks permission. You can see why people fume.</p><p>Not too long ago I stood in a crowded room to hear public consultations about the housing development that would replace Honest Ed's, which is a giant, gaudy, discombobulating Toronto discount store that people love more in theory than in practice. I can pretty much guarantee that none of the people in that room shopped at Honest Ed's, but you would think that their children were being sold for meat, they were so incensed. (More people should shop there, because it is the bazaar of the bizarre, and cheap to boot. Last week I noticed a silver casket for sale, under a hand-painted sign that read, 'No Exit.' This is not the sort of thing you find at Holt Renfrew.)</p><p>Even if they didn't shop at Honest Ed's, the people in that room felt a stake in the way the city was preserved, in how it looks, in the story it tells about itself. It's the same way that people in Ottawa must feel about the Chateau Laurier. How can you say goodbye to the face of an old friend?</p>, <p>Just what is a dignified death?</p><p>Proponents of assisted suicide constantly evoke the 'right to die with dignity' in seeking a Supreme Court of Canada ruling striking down Criminal Code provisions banning the practice. What they really mean is that they want to control the circumstances of their own deaths.</p><p>This is an an entirely legitimate desire, and the Supreme Court should grant them their wish. It's a free country, after all, and our Charter right to life and liberty surely includes the right to choose when and how to end it all.</p><p>But to suggest that ending one's life with the help of a doctor or loved one is the 'dignified' way to go is as shallow as it is hubristic. We come into this world helpless and, traditionally, most of us have gone out of it that way. That's not undignified. It's one of the things that makes us human.</p><p>Being human means admitting that we're often powerless to control the curveballs life throws at us and the people we love. All we can do is try and learn from them. This is anathema to baby boomers. Brainwashed by self-help books into believing they can control everything, they somehow forgot they were mortal. As they face their final decades, it's hitting them like a brick.</p><p>No wonder B.C. psychotherapist Gillian Bennett's recent suicide note struck such a chord with Canadians. Ms. Bennett chose to end her life before her dementia progressed to the stage of 'not knowing who I am.' She would have preferred waiting so that her husband could help her die when she got closer to 'gaga.' But the law still forbids that, and she wanted to outrun her disease before it outran her.</p><p>'I can live or vegetate for perhaps 10 years in hospital at Canada's expense ... It is ludicrous, wasteful and unfair,' the 85-year-old great-grandmother wrote. 'As we, the elderly, undergo manifold operations and become gaga while taking up a hospital bed, our grandchildren's schooling, their educational, athletic and cultural opportunities, will be squeezed dry.'</p><p>Of all the reasons to back assisted suicide, this is perhaps the worst and most dangerous.</p><p>The fact that we've organized our health-care system incoherently should not make chronic-care patients feel guilty about occupying scarce acute-care hospital beds. For every dollar our health-care system might save if more ALS, Alzheimer's, multiple sclerosis or terminal cancer patients ended their lives prematurely, we'd all lose a bit more of our humanity.</p><p>Our shifting demographics makes clear the need to reorganize our health-care system. Just 16 per cent of terminally ill Canadians have access to quality palliative care. And the majority of Canadian medical schools offer fewer than 10 hours of palliative-care training to new doctors. Until that changes, more dying Canadians will see assisted suicide as the 'dignified' way to go. This is the opposite of social progress.</p><p>Of course, we suffer when others suffer. But if a fatal diagnosis routinely becomes an invitation to assisted suicide, we are devaluing one of the most important parts of life - its ending. Given our modern medicine, no terminally ill patient should have to experience unbearable physical pain. The duress, for patients and their loved ones, is mostly psychological. And it scares us silly.</p><p>For many, such suffering is needless and pointless and they will never be persuaded otherwise. The law should be changed to accommodate them. But you don't have to be religious to feel that the dying - even gaga ones - pass on meaningful lessons to the living.</p><p>Think of Mrs. Henry Lafayette Dubose, the crotchety morphine addict from Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird. Atticus Finch forces his son Jem to read to her daily to ease her through her withdrawal symptoms, as she seeks to 'die free.'</p><p>'I wanted you to see what real courage is,' Atticus tells Jem afterward. '... It's when you know you're licked before you begin but you begin anyway and you see it through no matter what. You rarely win, but sometimes you do. Mrs. Dubose won ... She was the bravest person I ever knew.'</p><p>Real life is not always so poignant, of course. It's raw and painful and its meaning is not always immediately apparent. But as humbling as a disease can be, it is never undignified to stick it out.</p>, <p>No one talks about the possibility of the working-class party forming the next government. The NDP has never reached the top. It's regarded as the stuff of pipe dreams. Prior to the last election, no one talked about it becoming the Official Opposition. It never had reached that perch either - until that election campaign played out.</p><p>To take the historic next step, the New Democrats don't need the great gains they made in that 2011 campaign. They need only about 20 more seats from their current 95. That would give them 115 which conceivably could be enough to form a slim minority.</p><p>Brad Lavigne, who served as principal secretary to the late Jack Layton, was one of the architects of the remarkable - some would call it flukey - 2011 surge. He left the orange wave team, but NDP leader Thomas Mulcair recently brought him back to be his senior campaign adviser.</p><p>During a 90-minute discussion, Mr. Lavigne spent most of the time targeting the Liberals, dismissively referring to them as 'the third party,' the designation his own flock laboured under so long. He left the impression that NDP guns will be concentrated less on the Conservatives than Justin Trudeau, who will be painted as a naive, inexperienced candidate of non-change. All this could suit Stephen Harper very nicely. A dogfight among progressives! Bring it on.</p><p>The NDP strategist was enthused about internal polling - all parties tend to boast about their internal polling - showing an 11-point lead over the third party on matters related to standing up for Mr. and Mrs. Mainstreet.</p><p>Call it working class or middle class, it is all the NDP cares about. 'Every one of our policies will be seen through that lens,' said Mr. Lavigne. 'Tom Mulcair is going to hammer that home. If it's good for the middle class, it's an NDP policy.'</p><p>In policy terms, this means a big child-care program, keeping the retirement age at 65 for benefits, hiking the minimum wage in areas where possible. Over the next few months, said Mr. Lavigne, the party will bring on new job creation plans, more measures to combat climate change, plans to restore democracy to a system overrun by one-man rule.</p><p>Internal polling shows that Mr. Mulcair is least known among the leaders, but Mr. Lavigne sees this as 'a wonderful opportunity.' When voters get to know him, they'll know where he is coming from. The Prime Minister is a career politician, he noted, while Justin Trudeau was brought up 'rubbing shoulders with kings and queens.' And so 'you contrast our leader's value set. He is the second oldest of 10 kids. He didn't have a trust fund left to him. His family pursued the middle class dream in Canada.'</p><p>There's that and there's his long years of experience - and there will be a campaign based on hope not fear.</p><p>Mr. Lavigne sees the NDP vote as being committed while 'the third party vote is very loose. Blow a little and the whole thing falls over.'</p><p>The strategist talks a good game. I remind him his party is almost 10 points down in the polls since the last election and is falling in Quebec. An Ekos survey, for example, shows a close four-party fight in the province. That would mean the NDP, which won 59 seats in Quebec in the last election, could lose a whopping 20-30 of them in that province alone. So long pipe dream.</p><p>The Lavigne response? 'Polls don't forecast an outcome.' The last election result told him that. But can the New Democrats pull off two electoral shocks in a row? Their optimism lies in the belief that the Liberals are riding high on a celebrity name alone, that their support will collapse in the campaign and that the vote for change will coalesce under the NDP banner.</p><p>Blow a little and the whole Trudeau edifice falls over. If it happens, the chance of the working-class party winning government is within reach.</p>, <p>The Ontario Liberal government's ambitious 'Draft Climate Change Action Plan,' the text of which was leaked to The Globe and revealed on Monday, left us scratching our heads. The problem is not the ambition: Ontario has rightly pledged to reduce greenhouse gases, with 1990 emission levels to be cut by 15 per cent in 2020, 37 per cent by 2030 and 80 per cent by 2050. Those targets won't be easy to achieve, but if the science on global warming is right (we think it is), and if the international commitments that Canada and much of the world have signed onto mean anything (they should), then a long-term plan to steadily reduce greenhouse gas output is necessary.</p><p>It's not Ontario's low-carbon destination that has amber lights flashing. It's the road it is choosing to get there.</p><p>Governments are terrible at central planning. They aren't any good at micromanaging an economy, because they don't have enough information to do it as efficiently as millions of consumers and companies, each of whom can size up their own costs and savings opportunities, while adjusting to constantly changing price signals. That's why most economists think the most efficient way to achieve a big social objective like reducing carbon emissions is to put a price on carbon and let citizens and businesses, through billions of individual decisions, figure out how best to lower their carbon costs. Unfortunately, Ontario's Liberal government appears to be cribbing from a different textbook.</p><p>The strategy laid out in the draft climate action strategy calls for Queen's Park to cajole or financially bribe Ontarians into or out of various forms of energy. The big objectives in the plan are to be achieved by subsidies, or flat-out government orders.</p><p>For example, 76 per cent of Ontario homes are currently heated with natural gas. The Liberals are proposing to offer subsidies 'of up to $20,000' to anyone purchasing a new home using electricity, rather than gas. That's the carrot. The government also wants new building regulations, which by 2030 will make it against the law to heat new homes with natural gas. There's the stick.</p><p>Switching millions of homes from natural gas to electricity is not technically difficult; it simply involves building more electricity-generating facilities and more transmission lines. But it won't be cheap. And that's the issue: How much will it cost - and is it the most cost-effective way of reducing greenhouse gas emissions?</p><p>Ontario also says that, within eight years, it wants every two-car household to have at least one electric vehicle, and it wants new car buyers to be 'encouraged' to go electric when buying their first car. The highway to that destination will be paved with taxpayer dollars. Electric car buyers will get a subsidy of 'up to $14,000 per vehicle' and 'up to $1,000' per home-charging station. There will be extra cash for low-income electric buyers, plus no sales tax on electric vehicles. And electric car owners will get free electricity if they charge up overnight.</p><p>Again, all of this is technically possible. Subsidizing hundreds of thousands of electric cars; building billions of dollars' worth of upgrades to the transmission grid; free electricity, paid for by taxpayers - it's all doable. But everything comes at a cost. Voters should be asking whether this is the low-cost route to a low-carbon future, or a high-cost detour that, by abusing society's most finite resource - the wealth of its taxpayers - will actually end up making it harder to reach that low-carbon future.</p><p>Some skepticism about the Great Electric Leap Forward is in order. The Ontario Liberals are, remember, the government behind the last attempt at remaking the electricity system - which was so poorly conceived and so little understood by its architects that it turned the province into North America's leader in overpriced power. According to the provincial Auditor-General, consumers and businesses have overpaid for electricity by $37-billion over the past eight years, and will overpay by another $133-billion by 2032.</p><p>Those costs have put not one extra cent into provincial coffers. The province simply figured out how to make electricity production more inefficient. Taxpayers and ratepayers will be footing the bill for decades.</p><p>But Ontario's last energy fiasco does provide at least one lesson the government should be taking to heart: Consumers pay attention to prices. Over the past decade, Ontario's population has risen by 10 per cent and real economic output is up 14 per cent - but in the face of skyrocketing electricity costs, power consumption has fallen 13 per cent. When people are charged more for something, they will figure out how to use less of it. They don't need the government to order them to do it.</p><p>Instead of trying so hard to impersonate Soviet central planning, it would be better if Ontario put more emphasis on reducing carbon by taxing it. Consumers are usually better placed than central planners to read the price signals and figure out how best to save energy - and save their own money.</p>, <p>The outrage from the Opposition over a standing committee's hearings into how Canadians learn about their history is overwrought and somewhat naive. Where critics see a manipulation of our past for political purposes, calmer heads see a legitimate interest in how this country is portrayed to the people who live here, and a concern that Canadians understand the sacrifices made by their ancestors. Furthermore, history is constantly being rewritten, and any public discussion about that is a good thing.</p><p>The House of Commons Heritage Committee began hearings on Monday, but only after its Conservative-dominated membership dropped a plan to study how history is taught in schools. This was a sensible decision, as education is a provincial jurisdiction. The committee, however, is proceeding with a review of what it considers to be 'significant aspects in Canadian history' and how they are commemorated in federal programs and elsewhere outside of schools. This is a perfectly legitimate undertaking by such a committee.</p><p>Critics are using the hearings to contend that an emphasis by the Harper government on Canada's many military accomplishments, such as the recent celebrations of the War of 1812, are a partisan effort to remake the country in the Conservatives' image. But that's an absurd contention. How are any such commemorations a partisan matter? Did liberals not die alongside conservatives in the trenches of the First World War? Many of the young soldiers in any of the wars very likely had no party affiliation.</p><p>The first day of hearings included testimony from a man who was concerned that he couldn't find adequate information about Canadian soldiers' participation in the Allied landings in Sicily during the Second World War. More than 500 Canadians were killed during the liberation of Sicily, yet the public knows little about this fact. Is it a partisan desire to see such sacrifices properly commemorated?</p><p>The Conservatives are not rewriting history; rather, they are interested in making sure Canadians understand that the rights and freedoms we enjoy are a precious inheritance that deserves celebration. If anything, this interest is an act of nation-building that should be embraced.</p><p>Writing a nation's history takes time; the historical significance of the Harper government will not be fully understood or clearly written for a number of decades. But surely, when that does happen, it will not include a condemnation of a standing committee's desire to discuss the accepted wisdom of the day about Canada's past, and whether the federal government, within the boundaries of its jurisdictions, might want to highlight overlooked events.</p>, <p>In the summer of 2010, more than 200 institutions and individuals asked Stephen Harper's government not to eliminate the long-form census.</p><p>They represented a Who's Who of experts in statistics. All sorts of groups, from B'nai Brith to business associations and trade unions, argued that the long-form census, which required some, but only some, citizens by law to answer questions for Statistics Canada, was essential for presenting the most accurate statistical profile of Canadians.</p><p>To no avail. The Prime Minister had made up his mind. His hapless minister, Tony Clement, had to toe the line. He did so in such a way as to misstate the true views of the head of Statistics Canada, who resigned in protest.</p><p>It is worth recalling that assault on basic information and disregard for expertise now that more than 150 political scientists, including some of the most eminent in Canada, not to mention the head of Elections Canada, have urged the government to reconsider some of the key provisions of its Fair Elections Act.</p><p>The very name is a misnomer, as the critics have argued. It will not make elections fairer; indeed, it will likely produce the reverse.</p><p>Recall the process before considering the bill's provisions. Democracy and elections do not belong to any party. Organizing them is not the responsibility of the government of the day.</p><p>Therefore, the proper way to proceed in updating the election law is to a) ask the office that knows the most about elections, that is Elections Canada; b) ask an all-party committee to study the issues. The way not to proceed is to have an elections bill drafted by the government, rammed through the Commons on second reading, then sent to committee, where the government's majority will prevail.</p><p>This is how the government is proceeding, led by Minister for Democratic Reform Pierre Poilievre, a young man who leaped into the cabinet principally for his leather-lunged abilities at partisan verbal jousting. Anyone who believes Mr. Poilievre can act on just about anything without the interests of the Conservative Party at heart has not been observing his career thus far. Unbridled partisanship has its place in politics, one supposes, but not for updating elections law.</p><p>As Prof. Paul Thomas of the University of Manitoba (and a member of the Elections Canada advisory board) pointed out in a paper he wrote about the proposed changes, Britain's electoral commission was extensively consulted before changes to the law. Here, Mr. Poilievre said he spent an hour with Chief Electoral Officer Marc Mayrand before drafting the bill. Obviously, he did not highly value Mr. Mayrand's analysis during their brief meeting, since the Chief Electoral Officer just dumped all over important parts of the bill before the parliamentary committee.</p><p>Prof. Thomas also explained that 2011 public-opinion surveys reveal a high level of confidence in Elections Canada. Eighty-five per cent of eligible voters felt Elections Canada ran a fair election in May, 2011.</p><p>The Conservative Party, however, was mad at Mr. Mayrand, because the elections office had caught the party out on the 'in-and-out' scheme, which involved circumventing election spending rules, and in the robocalls affair. So the Conservatives set about, as they do with those whom they decide are 'enemies,' to weaken the powers of Elections Canada.</p><p>This weakening is among the issues that has the 150-plus political scientists up in arms. They highlight that the new bill would move enforcement from the commissioner of elections under Elections Canada to the director of public prosecutions, who reports to the government, not Parliament.</p><p>The bill would exempt fundraising costs from campaign expenses as long as the fundraising is directed at those who have given more than $20 in the past. This is clearly designed to assist the Conservatives, who have more donors and already raise more money.</p><p>The bill would eliminate vouching - taking an oath if standard forms of voter identification are not available. This change could disenfranchise some of the poorest citizens. The bill would also prevent - and this is simply crazy - Elections Canada from encouraging people to vote, leaving this effort entirely up to political parties.</p><p>There are other dubious parts of this ill-considered bill. Will the critics, who know a great deal about elections and have no partisan axes to grind, be heeded? We can only hope.</p>, <p>In his book Believer, David Axelrod tells of Barack Obama's 'Yes we can!' moment.</p><p>Mr. Axelrod, the Obama image guy, liked the phrase because it gave voters a stake in making change happen. He put it in as the closing line for one of Mr. Obama's ads. But when the candidate saw it, he wasn't overly impressed. ' 'Yes we can.' Is that too corny?' the future president asked. His wife, Michelle, was seated on a staircase. 'Meesh, what do you think?'</p><p>'Not corny,' she said.</p><p>And thereafter, 'Yes we can!' became the rallying cry for the Obama presidential campaign.</p><p>But in office, Mr. Obama hasn't governed with that kind of emotional outreach. In his engaging and enlightening book, Mr. Axelrod reveals a liberal idealist who is the 'ultimate rationalist.' Mr. Obama is 'preternaturally cool,' he says, but has at times shown 'a hint of moral superiority' that hasn't done him any favours.</p><p>Mr. Axelrod teamed up with the young Mr. Obama when he was unknown because 'he addressed my growing sense of alienation from politics.'</p><p>In Canadian terms, with his rationalism, his hauteur, his cool, Mr. Obama has character traits reminiscent of Pierre Trudeau. Anyone wondering why Canada-U.S. relations have fallen into a state of 'No we can't' need only know that. Mr. Obama is Stephen Harper's opposite - operationally, stylistically and ideologically.</p><p>U.S. ambassador Bruce Heyman is being frozen out. Mr. Obama's man in Ottawa can't even get meetings with cabinet ministers. There are several bilateral irritants, but the White House refusal to approve the Keystone XL pipeline is at the heart of the matter. And that goes right to the philosophical differences between the men at the top. Mr. Obama is an environmentalist; Mr. Harper is not.</p><p>There's a common thread to Canada-U.S. relations. Whenever presidents and prime ministers are of differing political persuasions, they tend to clash and bilateral relations inevitably worsen. Witness Jean Chretien's fireworks with George W. Bush, compared to his harmony with fellow liberal Bill Clinton. Witness Mr. Trudeau's compatibility with Jimmy Carter, compared to his strained rapport with Richard Nixon.</p><p>Witness John F. Kennedy's confrontations with Tory John Diefenbaker, versus his warm embrace of Lester Pearson. Liberals Franklin Roosevelt got along famously with Mackenzie King - not so with R.B. Bennett.</p><p>So the surprise shouldn't be that relations are not good under Mr. Obama and Mr. Harper - but that they aren't a lot worse. Mr. Harper must think he's dealing with another Trudeau, while Mr. Obama must think he's dealing with another hard-right Republican, especially when the PM lectured him on Keystone, saying he wouldn't take no for an answer.</p><p>The two men do have one thing in common: They both win. Writing about Mr. Obama's takedown of the Republicans in 2008, Mr. Axelrod offers up some campaign strategy that Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau might wish to bear in mind: ' 'Barack's bet' was that 'candour was better than pander.' While he wasn't above the pleasing line, he understood that you could not wage war against conventional politics by acting conventionally.'</p><p>The book serves as another indicator of where Canada stands on Washington's priority list. There isn't one mention of Mr. Harper. The Prime Minister's anger at the neglect from this White House is understandable, especially on the Keystone file. Although Mr. Axelrod writes about how the President detests everything being reduced to raw political calculation, his partisan political interests sure seem to be in play on Keystone.</p><p>The larger consideration with Mr. Obama, though, is obviously his other work. The United States is certainly a lot better off under him than it was under Mr. Bush and Dick Cheney. After the ill-conceived ideological muscle-flexing of those gentlemen, the ultimate rationalist was the tonic.</p><p>As Mr. Axelrod contends, Mr. Obama brought the country back from the brink.</p>, <p>In December, Philippe Couillard, until then a rather pragmatic but not overzealous supporter of environmentalism, went to the Paris Climate Change conference and came back repainted in green. The Quebec Premier had been left starstruck by Al Gore.</p><p>The former U.S. vice-president and outspoken crusader had showered Mr. Couillard with laudatory comments about Quebec's record on the environment and had praised Mr. Couillard's 'fantastic leadership' on the issue. 'Quebec shows the way,' Mr. Gore intoned after Mr. Couillard announced that the province would donate $25.5-million to help poor francophone countries fight climate change.</p><p>So Mr. Couillard was still in seventh heaven when a reporter asked him why his government had a share in an exploration project on Anticosti Island, a sparsely populated natural reserve in the St. Lawrence River believed to contain vast reserves of oil and gas. Mr. Couillard, brutally brought back down to earth, erupted. 'That's not my project. I'm fed up with it. I would rather have not found it on my desk.'</p><p>The contract between the province and several energy companies was signed by the Parti Quebecois government shortly before the Liberals came to power, but - without enthusiasm - the Couillard government followed through. But, since the Paris conference, Mr. Couillard has started publicly attacking a project that is still subject to environmental studies. So far, Hydrocarbures Anticosti, which represents three companies and the government, has done 12 surveys and intends to drill in three spots this summer by fracking in order to evaluate the reserves' potential. This month, Mr. Couillard said he would 'do everything to prevent drilling on the island.' The door, he warned, is 'not even narrowly open.'</p><p>Alexandre Gagnon, the CEO of Petrolia, one of the consortium's companies, has been left in the dark. Nobody returns his calls. 'It's pretty weird,' he told La Presse. 'You're in business with a partner who keeps talking against the deal in public but refuses to talk to you.' However, he said people at Ressources Quebec, the group supervising the project, told him that everything is going ahead as planned. Quebec has invested $13-million in the project and is committed to a total of $57-million. Mr. Gagnon said the contract contains no withdrawal clause.</p><p>Still, Le Devoir has reported that 'members of the government' have been covertly encouraging environmental groups to publish studies detrimental to the Anticosti project. Environment Minister David Heurtel did not deny the story. 'All environmentalists should take part in the public debate,' he said.</p><p>The business community worries that the Premier's abrupt flip-flop will hurt Quebec's reputation in financial markets. 'What looked certain is not any more. This uncertainty will be very damaging,' said Francoise Bertrand, head of Quebec's Federation of Chambers of Commerce.</p><p>Andy Gustajtis, a Toronto banker who helped Junex, another oil company, raise money for projects in Quebec, is more direct. 'It's plain stupid,' he told La Presse. 'If you say to someone you don't want their money ... they'll go where they're welcome.'</p><p>Mr. Gore should have minded his words. Too much praise can go to some people's heads.</p>, <p>'Where the bee sucks, there suck I.' William Shakespeare, The Tempest.</p><p>The CBC has a new member of its board of directors. The Conservatives have appointed 35-year-old Rob Jeffery. He is a Halifax chartered accountant. He is senior director of taxation for Sobey's, a leading food retailer. You may be wondering what other compelling qualifications the young man has to preside over the state broadcaster in our complex, ever-changing media world?</p><p>Well, there is something else. He recently served two terms as treasurer for the Progressive Conservative Party of Nova Scotia.</p><p>It hardly requires a stretch of the imagination to reason that he got the appointment because he's been a loyal worker for the party who will likely do its bidding in the further emasculation of the CBC which, as we know, is not one of the Prime Minister's most favoured entities.</p><p>Mr. Jeffery shouldn't be singled out. He is only one of countless numbers who, courtesy of our well-entrenched practice of patronage, get lovely appointments without having much in the way of qualifications. It's what the spoils system is all about. The gravy train. It's a problem much, much broader than Senate appointments.</p><p>The system, as detailed years ago in Jeffrey Simpson's book, Spoils of Power, has been part and parcel of every government, not just Stephen Harper's. Most every government comes to power promising to clean it up and then does nothing to clean it up.</p><p>But if there is some good to come from all the stench arising from the Senate scandal, it is that it may be generating enough public disgust to force real change.</p><p>Patronage was big news back in the 1980s, when Brian Mulroney knocked over John Turner with his celebrated 'You had an option, sir!' castigation of the former Liberal leader's decision to countenance Pierre Trudeau's last-minute spurt of appointments of party members to cushy jobs.</p><p>The gravy train didn't stop under Mr. Mulroney or Jean Chretien. As a young Reform Party backbencher, Stephen Harper sounded like he wanted change. 'We don't think as a party that patronage has any place in the Parliament of Canada,' he said in 1995. In 2005, as leader of the Official Opposition, he went further, stating that patronage 'has got to stop, and when we become government, it will stop.'</p><p>And actually he did have a fine idea to halt it, or at least slow it down. When he came to power in 2006, he created an arm's-length Public Appointments Commission to handle the thousands of appointments the government makes. But it never got off the ground. Mr. Harper couldn't get the opposition parties to approve of his nomination to chair the commission and so he went back to the old way and patronage is now as rampant as ever.</p><p>The Senate presents a special patronage problem because governments need Red Chamber support to get their legislation passed. This has led to the blatant favouritism in Senate appointments. If elected, the NDP and Liberals promise change. The New Democrats, who don't have any senators, vow to abolish the chamber. The question is how? And how, without any senators, they will get legislation passed in the meantime is an intriguing question as well. As for Justin Trudeau, he has cut party ties to all Liberal senators, hoping in this way to create a more independent chamber.</p><p>As for taking action on the broader scourge of patronage, Tom Mulcair promises to create an independent public appointments commission, the discarded Harper idea. Much would depend on the degree of independence such a commission would have. In the case of Mr. Trudeau, beyond his laudable Senate initiative, we haven't heard much. But he would be wise to stake out a big committment for patronage reform soon.</p><p>With the Senate fiasco, the time is ripe to take down the spoils system, a blight that has been with us since the dawn of time, which is a tad too long.</p>, <p>Here's some bad news from the world of education: Math scores are in decline across Canada. Just as kids in Poland and Portugal and other formerly disadvantaged countries are taking great leaps forward, ours are going backward. Our high schools are graduating kids who have failed to grasp the fundamentals, and our universities are full of students who are struggling to master material they should have learned in high school.</p><p>What's gone wrong isn't a mystery. For the past decade and more, school systems across the country have been performing a vast experiment on your children. They have discarded 'rote' learning in favour of 'discovery,' a process by which students are supposed to come up with their own solutions to the mysteries of arithmetic. There's ample evidence that this approach leaves millions of kids (to say nothing of their parents) baffled and confused, and it is being abandoned in large parts of the United States. This has not deterred legions of Canadian education theorists and consultants from pressing on. Perhaps they're secretly in league with Kumon and Sylvan to drum up business.</p><p>Ontario Education Minister Liz Sandals thinks she knows why scores are slipping. Most elementary school teachers have backgrounds in the liberal arts. Their acquaintance with math is sketchy at best. (Ms. Sandals, no slouch with numbers, has a masters degree in math.) And teachers' college doesn't give them enough grounding. 'We need to deal with math so that the teachers have the same comfort level with teaching math that they do with reading and writing,' she said last week.</p><p>Actually, the problem is much deeper than that. The teachers may be clueless, but the methods they're supposed to use are bound to fail. The curriculum has downgraded arithmetic to near-invisibility. The 'progressive' approach to instruction guarantees that many students will not master basic skills, will not understand fractions, will not learn to multiply or divide two-digit numbers on their own. After all, that's what calculators are for!</p><p>'Provincial curriculum guides and math textbooks have been systematically expunged of the standard algorithms,' Manitoba teacher Michael Zwaagstra, a leading education critic, told me. An algorithm is simply a rule that tells you how to do stuff. For example, how do you add 2,368 and 9,417? If you learned the standard way, you'll stack the numbers and start adding from the right: 8+7=15, carry the 1 and so on.</p><p>That may be efficient, but it's hopelessly uncreative. With 'discovery' math, kids are encouraged to reinvent the wheel by, say, starting on the left, adding the thousands, then the hundreds, then the tens and ones, and adding them all up at the end. Then they have to write a story about how they got the answer. Needless to say, this takes a whole lot longer.</p><p>The trouble is that math is built on fundamentals. If you miss a building block, you're likely to become progressively confused. To make things worse, the current practice of social promotion - moving kids from grade to grade even if they're hopelessly at sea - guarantees that armies of youngsters whose parents can't afford Kumon will be left in the dark. So much for equality in education.</p><p>For years, math professors at our leading universities have been telling elementary and high-school educators that their methods don't work. But the educators and the teachers' colleges have refused to listen. After all, what do the professors know? They're just math geeks. They have no idea how to teach children. As a consequence, there is now an almost total disconnect between the math that's taught in most schools and the math that students need in university or the real world in order to succeed. It's notable that educators in Eastern Europe and Asia, in particular, are astounded by what they've seen happening in North America.</p><p>So maybe those sinking test scores are a good thing. The education establishment may be immune to public pressure, but politicians are not. In Manitoba, where math professors and parents have been up in arms, the government has announced a bold new policy - it's bringing back arithmetic! 'Let's face it,' Education Minister Nancy Allan told the Winnipeg Free Press, 'doing math in your head is important.'</p><p>As for parents who don't live in Manitoba, not all is lost. You can lobby, too. You can look up the Khan Academy on YouTube, which offers very good instructional videos for free. Or there's Kumon and its ilk. Wouldn't it be nice if our schools could put them out of business?</p>, <p>Wedge politics is a dangerous tactic, especially when it involves an attack on minorities. Unfortunately, it also often works.</p><p>Since the Parti Quebecois government announced, through calculated leaks to sympathetic tabloids, its intention to prohibit public-service workers from wearing religious symbols and articles of faith, it has gained five points in the polls. (Part of the gain may be due to Premier Pauline Marois's efficient and compassionate response to the Lac-Megantic disaster.)</p><p>The full text of the so-called Charter of Quebec Values won't be known until Sept. 9, but the explosive debate is already in full force, with the population and opinion-makers divided into two camps.</p><p>The issue doesn't pit sovereigntists against federalists, although the project plays on the old-style, defensive nationalism that has always brought powerful ammunition to the sovereigntist movement. Many left-leaning or libertarian sovereigntists are adamantly opposed to the project, including the leftist Quebec Solidaire party, which has two MNAs.</p><p>It's also a debate between Montreal, the cosmopolitan metropolis, and the outlying areas that are the quasi-exclusive domain of old-stock francophones - the irony being that those with the least exposure to the kippa and the niqab are the charter's most enthusiastic proponents, while Montreal City Council, which includes some prominent sovereigntists, unanimously passed a motion asking the government to 'back off' its rigid policy.</p><p>Meanwhile, the populist media are joyfully stoking the flames, manufacturing a 'crisis' with little basis in Montrealers' daily life. And, social media overflows with frightful anecdotes about the worst abuses of radical Islam, suggesting that this is Quebec's future if it continues to tolerate Muslim religious customs.</p><p>In Quebec, as in France, secularism often serves as a screen for plain xenophobia. Marine Le Pen, leader of France's far-right Front National, constantly invokes the tradition of laicite to justify anti-immigrant policies. In Quebec, the discovery of the concept dates from around 2007, coinciding with the rise of Muslim immigration and a few incidents involving unreasonable demands by fundamentalists.</p><p>Brandishing the noble principle of equality between men and women is another way to cover Islamophobia with a politically correct varnish. It's actually the stated goal of the PQ project. So what if banning the veil (seen as a symbol of female submission) from the public sector means that practising Muslim women will be barred from the best jobs - let alone nurses, educators and other professionals whose work usually takes place in public institutions.</p><p>For good measure, the future charter will also ban religious signs like kippas, turbans and oversized crosses - but in the National Assembly, the deputies will go on making laws under the guiding light of the crucifix that was installed there in 1936 by Maurice Duplessis, the arch-Catholic premier especially remembered for unabashed anti-Semitism and an infamous crackdown on Jehovah's Witnesses.</p><p>This crucifix has been promoted by the government to the rank of a 'patrimonial' object, like a historic cathedral or the cross on Mount Royal. Even the previous Liberal government didn't dare remove the crucifix for fear of offending the French-Canadian majority who clings to this identity symbol even while the churches go deserted. One can only conclude that secularism is something that's good for the 'others,' not for 'nous autres.'</p>, <p>Adam Dodek is co-director of the University of Ottawa's Public Law Group and author of the forthcoming second edition of The Canadian Constitution.</p><p>----------------------------------------------</p><p>When the trial of Mike Duffy began a year ago, it was clear that Canada's beleaguered Senate was just as much on trial before Justice Charles Vaillancourt as the senator was. While Mr. Duffy was found not guilty on all 31 charges, it is beyond a reasonable doubt that the Senate was convicted on Thursday.</p><p>Justice Vaillancourt acquitted Mr. Duffy on many charges based on Mr. Duffy's adherence to Senate policies, procedures and practices that have now become discredited. The Senate has had three years to respond to the issues raised by the Duffy scandal. It has failed to do so.</p><p>The Duffy affair could have been a catalyst for significant change in the Senate. Instead, the Senate continues to dawdle and dabble rather than having the will to embark on the sorts of reforms that are needed to have any hope of enhancing its legitimacy in the eyes of Canadians.</p><p>Instead of being a change leader, the Senate has to date ceded the initiative to others: First, to the Stephen Harper Prime Minister's Office; next to the RCMP; then to former Supreme Court justice Ian Binnie; and now to the government of Justin Trudeau. When will the Senate grab the reins to drive its own chariot instead of being led around by others?</p><p>To date, the Trudeau government has focused on the appointment process of senators. But it was never the process of appointing senators that created the Senate's problems, and changing the process will not rehabilitate the Senate. The problem is what they do once they get to the Senate.</p><p>For the Trudeau government, changing the appointment process has multiple goals. In communications terms, it has changed the channel about the Senate and trumpeted the message of doing Senate appointments differently. Strategically, the move was meant to separate the Prime Minister from the 'independent' senators that he is appointing, and also to herald appointing more diverse senators. No change in process was required for the latter; only political will and leadership. On separating the Prime Minister from the senators he appoints, if there turns out to be another Mike Duffy amongst them, no one will care about the process that appointed them. Whatever the process, these senators are and will remain Mr. Trudeau's.</p><p>Amidst all the scandals, investigations and external reforms, the Senate has remained in reactive mode. It has failed to address the core issues that gave rise to the Duffy scandal.</p><p>As a senator for Prince Edward Island, Mr. Duffy has faced both mocking and criminal charges. While he may have escaped conviction in connection to his residency issues, the Senate has not. The Red Chamber has done absolutely nothing to clarify the constitutional residency requirements. This is despite having the clear constitutional powers to do so.</p><p>Mr. Duffy spent much time stumping for the Conservative Party on the Senate's dime. His defence - which was ultimately accepted by the court - was that he was simply doing what the Senate allowed. The Senate responded by first bringing in the Auditor-General and then an arbitrator - Mr. Binnie. But what it has not done is overhauled its expense rules, increased its transparency and established a system of independent and regularized oversight.</p><p>After Mike Duffy, if the Senate wants to really get serious about earning the trust of Canadians, it needs to take bold steps. It should end the practice of senators treating their jobs like part-time gigs and ban them from having other jobs or earning active income from speaking (as Mr. Duffy did), sitting on corporate boards (as Pamela Wallin and many other senators do) or continuing to practise their profession while serving in the Red Chamber. An effective chamber of sober second thought requires the full-time attention of all of its members. The people of Canada deserve no less.</p><p>For Mr. Duffy, the verdict is an exoneration. For the Senate, it is nothing less than an indictment and a conviction on all counts. For the past three years, the Senate has failed to internalize the lessons of the Duffy scandal. The question is whether now after the verdict it will do so.</p>, <p>Lisa Goldman is director of the Israel-Palestine Initiative at New America, a Washington-based think tank.</p><p>Earlier this month, one of Israel's most famous writers announced in his weekly newspaper column that he was packing up his family and moving to the United States - permanently. Sayed Kashua, an Arab-Palestinian citizen of Israel who resides in Jerusalem, is the author of critically acclaimed novels and a popular television series, all written in Hebrew with wit and insight into the complex, conflicted society of Arabs and Jews living uneasily side-by-side. But after more than two decades of believing that ultimately Arabs and Jews would find a way to co-exist as equals, he wrote, something inside him 'had broken.' He no longer believed in a better future.</p><p>Mr. Kashua's decision to emigrate came in response to a series of events that were marked by violence and incitement against the Arab population, from the government to the street. One member of the Knesset, Israel's parliament, called for a war against the Palestinian people on her Facebook page. Another called an Arab legislator a 'terrorist' during a parliamentary committee session, while still another, the leader of an ostensibly centrist party, submitted a proposal to ban an established Arab nationalist party with sitting members of the Knesset. The editor of a right-wing newspaper suggested that now was the time to transfer the Arab population out of the occupied West Bank. In Jerusalem, mobs of hyper nationalist youth rampaged through the cafe-lined downtown streets chanting 'death to Arabs,' assaulting random passersby because they looked or sounded Palestinian. Most horrifically of all, a 17 year-old Palestinian boy from East Jerusalem was abducted from the street by six young Jewish men, three of them minors. The police found Mohammed Abu Khdeir's corpse in the nearby Jerusalem Forest shortly after CCTV cameras recorded some young men forcing him into a car. He had been doused with gasoline and burned alive. Three of the six boys confessed to the crime and re-enacted it for the police.</p><p>This orgy of internecine violence was sparked by the mid-June abduction of three Jewish teenage boys - Naftali Fraenkel, Gilad Shaer and and Eyal Yifrah - who were hitchhiking in the West Bank. The army carried out a massive three-week manhunt for the boys, that included pre-dawn raids and dozens of arrests; it ended with the discovery of three corpses buried in a field near Hebron. And while the men who committed the crime were almost certainly Palestinian, Hamas has vociferously denied involvement even as the Israeli government continues to accuse them of masterminding the abduction and murder as an act of terrorism.</p><p>After the nationally televised funerals for the boys, with moving eulogies delivered by their mothers, the country seemed to explode. Ultra nationalists openly organized anti-Arab demonstrations via Facebook groups. In response to the murder of Abu Khdeir, the Palestinian residents of East Jerusalem demonstrated violently against even more violent paramilitary police, three of whom were filmed beating a handccuffed and unconscious Palestinian-American boy named Tariq Abu Khdeir. And then the rage spread to the Galilee, where Palestinian-Arabs (sometimes called 'Arab Israelis') came out onto the streets to demonstrate; they were met by paramilitary police who used violent crowd control methods usually reserved for the occupied territories - rubber bullets, tear gas and brutal beatings. According to Adalah, a local NGO that monitors minority civil rights in Israel, the police arrested more than 400 Arab citizens for protesting.</p><p>And then the Israeli military announced its third military assault on Gaza in less than six years. The purpose of the operation, announced the government, was to destroy Hamas's military capacity, stop its military wing from launching rockets at civilian population centers, which was occurring more frequently since the army arrested Hamas members in the West Bank, and 'restore peace' to the areas of Israel that border Gaza. The vast majority of Israeli Jews support the military operation, called Protective Edge, but leftist Jews and the Arab minority organized anti-war protests, primarily in liberal Tel Aviv and then in Haifa, a mixed Arab-Jewish city.</p><p>There's nothing new in seeing a minority of Israelis protest a popular war. It is not unprecedented for that minority to be met by counter-protestors who wrap themselves in the flag and call out insults like 'traitor.' But this time something new and worrying happened: Peaceful, unarmed demonstrators in Israel's two most liberal cities were physically attacked by ultra-nationalists wielding stones and bottles. In Haifa, nationalist thugs assaulted the Arab deputy mayor, slamming the middle-aged man down on the pavement. In Tel Aviv, they chased anti-war protestors into a cafe and smashed a chair over the head of one of them, even as municipal sirens wailed to announce an incoming rocket from Gaza. The police were ineffective in stopping the violence. Later, it emerged that the ultra-nationalist attackers had organized via a Facebook group managed by a well-known rap artist - a tattooed, muscular fellow who goes by the name The Shadow.</p><p>Something has broken down in Israeli society. Friends who always said they would never leave because they were too deeply rooted in the place, its language and their families are deeply worried and even despairing over the radical rightward shift of the mainstream political discourse. Several have said they were looking for opportunities abroad because they couldn't see themselves raising their children in a country where dissent was slowly but surely being suppressed even as the national discourse hardened rightward.</p><p>Israel has always been a flawed democracy with many festering internal divisions. Its policies toward the Arab minority reflect the unresolved tension of a conflicted identity: Should Israel aspire to be a liberal democracy or a democracy for Jews? But in the five years since Benjamin Netanyahu was elected prime minister and formed a governing coalition composed of far-right, racist and anti-democratic parties, something very fundamental has changed in Israeli society. It feels as though the majority is willing to suspend essential elements of democracy in favor of Jewish nationalism. There doesn't seem to be a place for dissent anymore.</p>, <p>A few months ago, a Harvard senior named Reina Gattuso wrote a column in the school newspaper. It described her crummy night of drunken sex with a couple of men she didn't know. 'I have so much to drink my memory becomes dark water,' she wrote. She freely admitted that she consented. Enthusiastically. And that was the problem. She thought she would enjoy it, but instead she just felt rotten!</p><p>Most people might conclude from this experience that random sex with drunken strangers is a poor idea, and Ms. Gattuso really should not try that again. Old-fashioned moralists might even call such behaviour tawdry, degrading and sluttish. Not Ms. Gattuso. And not Rebecca Traister, the New York Magazine writer who wrote about it. To them, the moral of the story is that the world is awash in bad consensual sex. This is due to the persistent power imbalances between women and men. Until we fix this, women cannot be sexually happy. As Ms. Traister argues, 'The game is rigged.'</p><p>Ironically, today's feminists are serious about consent but casual about sex. And to their shock, they've discovered that there's an awful lot of bad sex out there. They did not expect this. They've been told they are supposed to be having a super-positive sex life - unconflicted, joyous, casual and abundant. They've been told they should be able to have as many partners and initiate sex just as often as men do. And they've tried that. And it hasn't worked out very well. Instead of feeling super-positive, they feel sexually dissatisfied, emotionally disconnected and more than a little used.</p><p>The surprise is that so many young women are surprised by this. Haven't they watched Girls?</p><p>The trouble isn't men, of course. Nor is it the culture. The trouble is that these women have been sold a lie. They've been told that the profound sexual and behavioural differences between men and women are merely matters of individual preference, which would largely dissolve if we ever managed to shed our noxious cultural baggage.</p><p>Nothing could be further from the truth, of course. These differences are to a great extent hard-wired. Female sexual desire can be as powerful and urgent as men's. But most women are only able to have good sex with men they feel connected to and trust; for most men, that's not the case. Most women really do not want sex unless it might lead to commitment. Men really do not want to invest a lot of time in women unless it leads to sex. And so it goes. Women's best reproductive strategy is to be selective. Men's best reproductive strategy is to be promiscuous. As Woody Allen once wrote: 'Sex without love is an empty experience ... But as empty experiences go, it's one of the best.'</p><p>Eventually men will bond with you, of course, and everything will change, and they will be willing, even eager, to faithfully protect you and your babies. But until that happens you really can't expect much from them.</p><p>I know all of this is a cliche. But it's also true. Unfortunately, the emotional, behavioural, hormonal and biochemical differences between the sexes are not taught in sex ed or gender-studies courses because the truth is considered so reactionary. Some people also consider it monstrously unfair to women. Sadly, much in life is unfair. Men can pee standing up. But what can you do?</p><p>Many of us learned this stuff the hard way, at the dawn of the feminist revolution. The 1970s were paradise for men. They told us that if we didn't sleep with them we must be unliberated and sexually uptight. I can't tell you how many women swallowed this cow manure before we smartened up.</p><p>But now, young women are peddling this manure to themselves. In a world that's already disturbingly oversexualized, they insist that sexual display and promiscuity (dare I use that word?) are synonymous with female empowerment.</p><p>These days, in fact, sexual restraint is a sign that something must be wrong with you. Last week, a young woman named Ali Rachel Pearl confessed in an essay in The New York Times that she hadn't had sex for two whole years. She can't really explain why. There was a guy who broke her heart, and so on. It turns out that this strange condition even has a name - 'secondary abstinence.' As she tells it, her friends are aghast. 'How can you go so long?' they ask. 'Get rid of your hang-ups.' 'Be more open.' 'Stop being afraid.' They all feel sorry for her.</p><p>It's so old-fashioned - this bizarre notion that maybe you should feel some attachment to the person you are sleeping with. Too old-fashioned for our most progressive and enlightened young women, who, I'm afraid, are in for a world of unnecessary hurt. If only feminists would smarten up about sex, our daughters - and our sons - would be a lot better off.</p>, <p>A political party's base is made up of the loyal voters who support it election after election, in good times and bad.  For the Conservatives, that's about 25-30 per cent of the national electorate. The 3,000 delegates who are attending the Conservative convention in Calgary represent the most active part of the base, the people who pound in lawn signs and pass out leaflets during election campaigns.</p><p>On Friday night,Stephen Harper spoke to the Conservative base, and quite successfully so.  After 12 years as leader of the Canadian Alliance and Conservative Party, he knows what members want to hear.   He rehearsed all his government's achievements, emphasizing themes that the base loves, such as abolition of the long gun registry, dismantling of the Wheat Board, punishing criminals and supporting the Canadian Forces.</p><p>Those in the media who speculated that he might try to explain the Senate mess that his appointments have created, and even apologize for it, have obviously not been paying attention for the last decade.  Mr. Harper explained nothing and apologized for nothing.  On the contrary, he dug in even further, calling for the speedy suspension of senators he had appointed and used so often as party fundraisers and campaigners.  In a defiant moment, he even avowed that he cared nothing for the criticism he has received, even within his own party, for ignoring considerations of due process and natural justice.</p><p>The speech worked well with the people in the hall, who were on their feet repeatedly, cheering and applauding. The same approach will also work well with the base at large.</p><p>There's other evidence that the Conservative base is still with Mr. Harper.  Despite misleading headlines in some newspapers, Conservative fundraising is as strong as ever.  There was a drop, as there always is, between the second and third quarters in 2013; but the party actually raised a hundred thousand dollars more in Q3 2013 than Q3 2012.  The Conservative Party is totally dependent upon grassroots donations; and if Mr. Harper ever loses the base, the results will show up very quickly in quarterly totals.  But that hasn't happened, which is great news for Mr. Harper, because a leader who loses his base is finished.</p><p>But there's also some bad news.  Ever since the Liberals chose Justin Trudeau as leader, they have led in almost every national poll, and the Conservatives have been drifting down to support levels around 30 per cent, the approximate size of their base. That's enough to keep the party alive and well, but not enough to win against the resurgent Liberals.</p><p>The Liberals, moreover, are finally showing they have learned how to conduct grassroots fundraising.  Why it took them ten years remains a mystery, but they seem to be getting there now.  In Q2 and Q3 of this year, they actually had more donors than the Conservatives, though the latter raised more money because their average gift was much larger.</p><p>The most plausible explanation of the Liberal pattern of results - large numbers of very small donations -is that they are successfully using the Internet to harvest small gifts from the new supporters attracted during their leadership race, especially by Mr. Trudeau.  If this is indeed the trend - and no will ever tell you the whole truth in the secretive world of party fundraising - it's bad news for the Conservatives, because, with the right approach, small Liberal donors can be turned into bigger donors.</p><p>Conservative fundraising was crucial in the last two elections.  The Conservatives used their financial advantage for campaigns of unanswered  negative advertising to destroy the credibility of Liberals leaders Stephane Dion and Michael Ignatieff before the writ was dropped, turning the official campaign into a mopping-up operation.  If the Liberals work their way up to financial parity with the Conservatives, a new strategy may be required.</p><p>Tom Flanagan is a distinguished fellow at the School Public Policy, University of Calgary, and a former campaign manager for conservative parties.</p>, <p>Everybody has an opinion about Kathleen Wynne's surprise election victory in Ontario. According to some experts (mostly at the National Post and in the West), the voters of Ontario are a bunch of morons. We irresponsibly rejected the path of fiscal responsibility and doubled down on the reckless wastrels who led us down the path of economic ruin. Thanks to us, our province is the drunken sailor of Confederation.</p><p>Other experts (mostly at the Toronto Star) see it differently. The wise voters of Ontario have sensibly rejected the Tea Party-style politics of destruction and embraced an enlightened approach to economic management. Invest to grow! Justin Trudeau is ecstatic, and Stephen Harper had better watch out.</p><p>My opinion is that voters aren't that nuanced. They voted for the gang they thought would screw things up the least. The ballot question wasn't about policies. It was about safe hands. Kathleen Wynne persuaded them that despite the ball-and-chain of the Liberal legacy, her hands were a whole lot safer than Tim Hudak's.</p><p>There's a lot to be said for such a clear-cut outcome. Ms. Wynne will not have to court the NDP to stay in power. When showdown time comes with the unions - as it will - she will have a freer hand to behave firmly.</p><p>Another plus is that the Conservatives will have to start over. The old Mike Harris gang is finished, and good riddance. Their message was as awful as their leader. If you're selling fiscal discipline, you also have to sell the upside - as well as the sense that you can manage through the tough times. Tim Hudak failed on both counts. All he offered was the prospect of certain chaos, and who wants that?</p><p>Ms. Wynne will now have to perform a neat trick. She will have to implement her left-wing budget and then start governing from the right. She will have to start persuading the people of Ontario that although they are accustomed to jam yesterday and jam today, there will be a lot less jam tomorrow. I do not know how she will accomplish this. She will have to keep some campaign promises and break others. She will have to enforce her promise to hold the line on public-sector wage costs (good luck with that), and she will also have to find what are known euphemistically as 'new revenue streams.' This means raising taxes on hard-working people exactly like you. Surprise!</p><p>There are two unpleasant truths about Ontario's economy that nobody mentioned during the election. First, politicians do not have a magical ability to create jobs, and most of the factors that have created hard times in Ontario (such as the decline of manufacturing) are mostly out of their control. Second, economic growth won't bail us out. Low growth is the new normal. Blame demographics. New workers barely outpace new retirees and immigration can't make up for that. As Douglas Porter, the Bank of Montreal's chief economist, says,'Get used to it.'</p><p>Ms. Wynne has the personality traits of a good high-school principal: steady, consensual, pragmatic. But can she be strict? We shall see. Strictness is out of fashion, yet it will be essential if Ontario is to avoid the wrath of the bond raters. And that means conflict. If she does her job, she can look forward to teachers' strikes and tax revolts. In fact, she can expect to be reviled by almost everyone.</p><p>As for Justin's happy dance, not so fast. The biggest election issue these days - especially for the swing voters in Toronto's suburbs - isn't who has the best policies, or which scandal led the news last week, or even who has the most inspiring vision for the future. It's who you can trust not to screw things up too much. Everything else is incidental.</p>\n"

      "<p>The federal Conservatives' reported intention to introduce a bill to enable individual aboriginals living on a reserve to acquire and own land on that reserve, if the first nation in question opts in to such a regime, is a welcome step forward.</p><p>Not many native leaders are now in favour of such a change, but if a few communities were to thrive as a result of the new legislation, opinion would probably shift.</p><p>The Conservatives' election platform of 2006 promised to 'support the development of individual property ownership of reserves, to encourage lending for private housing and business.' Their platforms in 2008 and 2011 were less clear. But after a year of majority government, they seem poised to act on a six-year-old plank.</p><p>There may be clues to the contents of the future bill in a book published in 2010, Beyond the Indian Act: Restoring Aboriginal Property Rights, by Tom Flanagan (a political science professor who was the Conservatives' campaign manager in 2004), Christopher Alcantara and Andre Le Dressay. The authors propose that communities could opt in to a property regime in which individual band members could acquire 'fee simple' - that is, basic, normal land ownership, including the right to sell and to mortgage the land.</p><p>They also propose that each first-nations community would have and keep an underlying right to the land analogous to the title to which all land in Canada is now subject, held either by the Crown in right of a province or - in the territories - by the Crown in right of Canada: in other words, the provincial and federal governments.</p><p>The crux of the issue may be that many first nations would still want to limit a band member's sale to other members, which is usually quite a small market. That would also give pause to mortgage lenders, in case of a default.</p><p>Long leaseholds may yet turn out to be a more broadly acceptable alternative.</p><p>For all its considerable merits, Beyond the Indian Act does not include a draft bill. The devil may yet be in the details. In the end, a conclusion about such proposals can be drawn only after legislation has been actually tabled in the House of Commons. That prospect in itself is real progress.</p>, <p>The draft constitution for Egypt is an assault on women's equality and press freedom and an invitation to dictatorship. It should not be rushed into law, and if it is sent to voters hastily, which Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi is seeking to do in an effort to undermine the opposition's ability to organize to defeat it, then it will fail the fundamental test of a foundational document, which is to represent the aspirations of a people. It will be illegitimate.</p><p>An Islamist-dominated assembly, which included only four women, has agreed on a new constitution. There are important provisions, such as term limits for the president and a prohibition on the use of torture and arbitrary detention, privacy of communication, and freedom of assembly. These are not small things in a country that suffered for decades under dictatorship. Even provisions that provide for some independence for the country's military, in the context of Egypt, is not necessarily bad, if it were to assume the role the military has traditionally had in Turkey, as a brake against fundamentalism.</p><p>However, the draft uses strange language in several areas, notably around women. While it promises equality for all, the only article that specifically mentions women's rights says that the state should 'balance between a woman's obligations to family and public work.' The article also says that the 'state should commit to preserving the true nature of the Egyptian family.' Elsewhere, the document declares that the state should 'protect ethics and morals.' There are also provisions with worrying implications for press freedom, including those that ban blasphemy and certain forms of 'insult.'</p><p>Human Rights Watch has expressed concern over the broad language of a number of provisions, and the liberal opposition sees in some of them the potential for repression. Such concerns are understandable in light of recent decrees by Mr. Morsi to grant himself sweeping new powers and to place himself above judicial oversight.</p><p>Hundreds of thousands of people have participated in protests against the decrees, and journalists and independent newspapers have suspended publishing for a day to highlight their concerns. The rush to the polls could well extinguish an important debate that needs to happen around the draft document. Just as it was two years ago after the overthrow of Hosni Mubarak, Egypt is at a brittle moment in its transformation into a modern state.</p><p>The constituent assembly was not drafting a code of conduct for the Muslim Brotherhood. The constitution will be the basis for Egypt's future, and will set important precedents for the Arab and Muslim world. Mr. Morsi and his confreres should not be allowed to pull a fast one.</p>, <p>Without help from the international community, hard-won gains in Afghanistan will almost certainly be reversed once NATO forces withdraw in 2014, putting the country at risk of even more violence and chaos.</p><p>That's why a conference in Tokyo on Sunday is so important. Donor countries are expected to pledge a commitment to future aid, in exchange for the Afghan government's undertaking to address long-standing concerns about corruption and waste.</p><p>Security is the most immediate challenge in the war-torn country, with at least $4-billion a year needed to build up the Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF) to 380,000 members, and Canada has pledged $110-million over three years for that purpose. But development, infrastructure, social and human rights projects are as important to Afghanistan's long-term transition as police and military training. Without democratic institutions, including a functioning judiciary, a country cannot advance. Donors, including Canada, should continue to ask the Afghan government to implement reforms, including better safeguards against fraud.</p><p>Of particular concern are the rights and freedoms of women. During the 1996-2001 Taliban government, their rights were severely curtailed; they were banned from going to school and working, and required to wear a burka, a head-to-toe outer garment. There has been much progress since the Taliban was ousted 11 years ago, including better access to education and health care for women and girls. And yet they remain targets of violence and still face enormous challenges. Schools are routinely attacked, students are poisoned, and women are imprisoned for 'moral crimes,' defined as attempting to escape domestic abuse and forced marriages.</p><p>'Donors should make it clear that continued progress on women's rights is linked to continued international support,' notes Brad Adams, Asia director at Human Rights Watch. 'The decisions that donors make today will have huge implications for the lives of ordinary Afghans in the years ahead.'</p><p>The international community should not forget that effective security also requires good governance. The road ahead for Afghanistan will be even more precarious if development challenges aren't addressed, and women's newly won rights and freedoms aren't protected.</p>, <p>This weekend, Liberals face some big choices about their party's future. The debate over primaries is really just a sideshow.</p><p>What are the key questions? Will the Liberal Party remain a tightly controlled club or transform itself into a modern, mass political movement? Are Liberals ready to convert top-down control of party processes into bottom-up empowerment of their supporters? Will they vote for an open party, accessible to all Canadians? Or do they want a closed party, where membership has its privileges and insiders call the plays?</p><p>The Liberal Party sees itself as the party of progress and reform, the voice of the people. Too long preoccupied with internal battles and pointless insider games, it's now estranged from its base. Voters have grown weary and disconnected, while Liberal insider elites, obsessively hoping for a saviour, have watched their vote fall for more than a decade.</p><p>More than ever, Liberals need to revisit the darkest moments of their history, when creativity and courage were all they had.</p><p>Canadians have sent Liberals to the political woodshed on three previous occasions - 1930, 1958 and 1984. Each time, the party was seen as arrogant, out of touch and out of date. Liberals bounced back from defeat by doing two things: reaching out to new people with new ideas, and modernizing their organization. Once modernized and renewed, the party earned its way back to governing Canada - for 22 consecutive years the first time, for 21 almost continuous years the second time, and for 13 years in a row the last time this happened.</p><p>In each generation, the party's modernization proposals were first thought by some to be radical and fraught with risk. But Liberal reformers carried the day because, each and every time, they were inspired by the vision of a more open, democratic, transparent and accountable party and because Liberals had the courage to embrace change.</p><p>This weekend, Liberals will be considering a series of bold proposals to bring their party into the 21st century and vault it ahead of its opponents - including a much-mooted primary-style leadership selection process. But primaries make no sense unless three of the other 'radical' proposals are adopted first:</p><p>1. A national riding-basedfundraising appeal for a major investment in a National Call Centre to optimize the party's technology backbone in support of the party's outreach, organization and fundraising activities.</p><p>2. A national person-to-personorganizational drive to register 'supporters' so Liberals can overcome their 'data' deficiency, rebuild the party's relationships with the millions of Canadians who want to vote Liberal, and create a robust database of supporters from which to quickly expand membership, worker and donor lists.</p><p>3.Widening participation in selecting the next permanent leader and the next generation of Liberal candidates beyond the paid membership to all registered party 'supporters.'</p><p>These proposals, if adopted, would revolutionize democratic engagement in Canada, changing the very nature of political power and how it's exercised by our politicians. But will Liberals have the courage to lead? Will they vote to truly open up their party, by committing to building a data-driven political communications technology platform and by offering ordinary Canadians a say in choosing the faces and voices of the next Liberal generation?</p><p>Primaries could easily become just another gimmick. But if Liberals have courage to do first things first and do them well, Canadian-style leadership primaries will matter, the party will rise again and Canadian politics will be transformed for the better.</p><p>Alfred Apps is the outgoing president of the Liberal Party of Canada.</p>, <p>It is going to be difficult for anyone in the U.S. election campaign to outperform Republican Senate candidate Todd Akin in the gaffe department. But as abhorrent as his lukewarmly retracted claim that a woman can prevent herself from becoming pregnant during a rape was, it is perhaps equally disturbing - and of greater consequence - that the Republican Party is now perilously close to endorsing an absolute ban on abortions, including for victims of rape and incest.</p><p>Mr. Akin, a U.S. Representative from Missouri running for the Senate, said on Aug. 19 that in 'a legitimate rape, the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down.' This notion dates back to medieval times in England, when it was believed that a woman could only conceive during consensual sex; a law at the time consequently said that pregnancy was absolute grounds for acquittal on a charge of rape.</p><p>Lawmakers and physicians in the 13th century can be forgiven for their medical errors; Mr. Akin had no excuse, and was immediately pilloried by fellow Republicans and asked to step down as the party's candidate. Presumptive Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney distanced himself from the remark and reiterated that, while opposed to abortion, he personally would allow it for rape and incest victims.</p><p>But here is the problem: Mr. Romney's running mate, Paul Ryan, is a well-known and vocal opponent of abortion in cases of rape and incest, or even when the mother's health is in danger. As well, the GOP's platform committee last week adopted a strict anti-abortion provision that will likely be formally adopted at the Republicans' convention in Florida this week. The provision calls for a constitutional amendment outlawing abortion without exception.</p><p>Thus, on the one hand the Republican Party is noisily condemning a lone candidate with a poor grasp of human reproductive biology, while on the other it might embrace the same policy that this misconception led him toward. If that indeed proves the case, the Republican backlash against Mr. Akin will have been a somewhat empty gesture.</p>, <p>For decades, you've been able to find Bev Davies squeezed against the stage of even the most raucous concerts.</p><p>Dressed in dark clothes, armed with a trusty Canon, she is still and contemplative even while all around her is frenzy.</p><p>She has photographed the famous (Bono, James Brown), the infamous (Iggy Pop, John Lydon) and the obscure, capturing in an instant a revelatory image from even the most familiar figures.</p><p>She's been doing it for so long that young concertgoers now approach to ask if she has a son in the band.</p><p>'They've been kind enough not to ask if my grandson is in the band,' she said.</p><p>Her black-and-white photographs have graced posters, album covers and the slapdash pages of fanzines. They have been in the pages of the Georgia Straight and on the walls of art galleries. Her image of the high-flying, scissor-legged bassist Randy Rampage of D.O.A. has even been imprinted on a limited-edition skateboard.</p><p>Some of her work is ephemeral, some of it timeless, and some of it only lasts as long as there are days in a month.</p><p>Ms. Davies has produced her sixth calendar of rock photographs, this one distributed free with each copy of theBusy Doing Nothing! album put together by the Vancouver deejay Nardwuar the Human Serviette.</p><p>The photographer's legion of fans prefer to think of her latest calendar coming with a free vinyl LP.</p><p>The calendar runs from May, 2012, until December, 2014, merrily ignoring the pending Mayan apocalypse.</p><p>It includes 17 photographs, including a striking cover shot of a teenager doing a jackknife dive off the stage into a crowd at a 1981 punk show in Pasadena, Calif.</p><p>Other notable shots include a fully clothed Iggy Pop casting a mesmerizing stare; Viv Albertine of the Slits in a babydoll dress a full decade before Courtney Love ever hit the stage; a sweaty and straining James Brown ('a bit too much girdle,' notes the photographer); an exhausted and shirtless Lux Interior of the Cramps on a leopard-patterned couch backstage at the Commodore Ballroom; and Bono being grabbed by stagehands before tipping into the crowd at an outdoor festival in California.</p><p>One of her favourite images depicts John Lydon of Public Image Ltd. wearing a pajama-style shirt on stage at War Memorial Gymnasium in Vancouver.</p><p>'I like the shape of it,' Ms. Davies said. 'So many of the shots are close-ups of people singing and playing guitar. He's listening to the audience. He's got his hand cupped to his ear.'</p><p>She began photographing the nascent local punk-rock scene in the late 1970s, suffering a black eye on her first shoot when she brought her camera to her eye while in the midst of the mosh pit. She quickly learned to keep elbows high while staking a spot stage left or right.</p><p>It was an exciting time when unknown do-it-yourself musicians filled out nightly lineups in dingy halls and decaying clubs. Ms. Davies offered a calm presence in a turbulent time. Her images were warmly received by the bands.</p><p>They were unknowns, but she thought they'd some day be famous.</p><p>She had seen it happen before.</p><p>Ms. Davies, the daughter of an auto mechanic and a potter from Belleville, Ont., left home to study art in Toronto. The Yorkville folk scene was 'breaking out and turning on and tuning in and dropping out,' she said. For a time, she helped operate the Cellar Club, a jazz and chess club at 169 Avenue Rd., where musicians would drop by to jam and hang out after playing gigs. Among them was Neil Young, whom she befriended. He announced one day that he was leaving for California in a '53 Pontiac hearse. Bev was invited to join him, though he wanted her to chip in for the cost of gas to the coast. She was penniless.</p><p>'The invite was pulled away,' she said. 'Neil said I couldn't go because I didn't have any money.' Her reaction? 'At that time, Neil didn't handle women crying very well.'</p><p>Two of her roommates joined him on the transcontinental trek. Soon after arriving in Los Angeles, Mr. Young formed a group called Buffalo Springfield and within days opened for the Byrds. It happened for him just that quickly.</p><p>Later, after she settled in Vancouver, Ms. Davies befriended the science-fiction writer Philip K. Dick. They first talked when she called an open-line radio show on which he was appearing. Intrigued, he later asked the host for her contact information. They went for dinner - an odd experience for Ms. Davies, still broke, who associated such extravagance with visits by her parents - and established a platonic friendship.</p><p>He later wrote her a warm letter in which he described his latest relationship woes - he would be married five times before his death in 1982 - with candour.</p><p>'Bev, you were nicer to me than anyone else I met in Canada, and I'll always remember that,' he wrote. 'You made me feel like a person.'</p><p>In recent years, acolytes and those studying Mr. Dick have approached the photographer for her insights on the writer.</p><p>'He was nice,' she said. 'He wasn't crazy. I know crazy.'</p><p>She continues to attend shows, her dedication creating an important documentation of the music scene in Vancouver over the decades. Incredibly, her work has yet to be gathered in a book.</p><p>Special to The Globe and Mail</p>, <p>The Supreme Court of Canada's split decision on whether a woman can wear a religious veil in the courtroom strikes a reasonable balance between competing rights. Rather than an 'all' or 'none' approach, the court outlined a four-part approach toward answering the question: Should a woman be required to remove her niqab while testifying? This framework will apply on a case-by-case basis, and the result will depend on each case.</p><p>As the court ruled, no right is absolute. In trying to reconcile the right of religious freedom versus the right to a fair trial, we should consider four questions.</p><p>First, what's the level of sincerity of the niqab wearer? The key is whether she believes she's required to wear the veil. In keeping with previous case law, it doesn't matter whether hers is a minority belief within her own faith. And occasional removal doesn't indicate a weakness of sincerity. In the case before the court, the Toronto complainant known only as N.S. indicated that she had removed her niqab when renewing her driver's licence, and at border crossings for identification purposes.</p><p>Next, would allowing the witness to wear her niqab while testifying create a serious risk to a fair trial? Here, the majority discussed the importance of observing the demeanour of the witness - including facial expression - as part of the cross-examination. This has been an integral practice historically, and serves as a key tool in assessing the credibility of a witness. But Madam Justice Rosalie Abella dissented, citing situations where demeanour is difficult to assess because of various impediments, including the use of an interpreter, a speech impediment, or partial facial paralysis due to stroke. According to Judge Abella, 'witnesses who wear niqabs should not be treated any differently.'</p><p>Third, if the answer to the first two questions is Yes, then the judge must see whether there's a way to reasonably accommodate both rights in the case at hand.</p><p>Finally, if no accommodation is possible, then the judge must weigh the harms and benefits of requiring the witness to remove her niqab. The former includes the broader societal harm of 'discouraging niqab-wearing women from reporting offences and participating in the justice system.' Beneficial effects include 'preventing harm to the fair trial interest of the accused and safeguarding the repute of the administration of justice.' Here, the judge will have to weigh how central each of the following factors is to the case: the witness's testimony, cross-examination and credibility assessment, and the nature of the proceedings.</p><p>In addition to the specific legal issues, the Supreme Court judges commented on wider societal issues.</p><p>Chief Justice Beverley McLachlin reiterated that, when faced with conflicts between freedom of religion and other values, the 'Canadian approach' has been to 'respect the individual's religious belief and accommodate it if at all possible.' This approach is entrenched in our laws.</p><p>The Chief Justice also said a total ban on the niqab is an intrusion by the state that's not consistent with the Charter of Rights. The onus is on the government to show that such an intrusion is in the public good, or is due to conflicting interests. This may be used in a future challenge against the government's blanket niqab ban at citizenship ceremonies. Furthermore, in the sexual assault case at hand, N.S. swore an oath on the Koran in court without having to remove her niqab to see whether she mouthed the words.</p><p>Unlike the Chief Justice's nuanced approach, Mr. Justice Louis LeBel suggested that a ban on niqabs in the courtroom would convey 'openness of the trial process' and highlight the importance of clear, open communication in courts, adding 'it would also be consistent with the tradition that justice is public and open to all in our democratic society.' How would banning the niqab convey that justice is open to all?</p><p>Judge Abella, on the other hand, believes the niqab should be allowed in the courtroom, since cross-examination will include analysis of the witness's voice, pitch and body language. More important, denying a woman the right to wear her niqab forces her to choose between her religious belief and access to justice. This may prevent others from testifying.</p><p>This case should serve as a catalyst for Muslim communities to begin meaningful discussion about sexual assault. For too long, it has been a taboo subject, hidden as an object of shame and rarely discussed in broad moral terms. This weekend, as 20,000 Muslims participate in the Reviving the Islamic Spirit conference in Toronto, organizers should take the opportunity to address this topic to an engaged audience.</p>, <p>In the end, it was a prosaic ruling confirming the U.S. federal government's jurisdiction in matters of immigration that undid Arizona's draconian crackdown on illegal immigrants. But since the crackdown had more than a whiff of police state to it, this unexpected decision from a right-leaning U.S. Supreme Court is very welcome and carries broader, and mostly positive, implications for America's troubled relationship with the 12 million illegal immigrants inside its borders.</p><p>The Supreme Court's ruling confirms that states can't set up immigration schemes that intrude on federal jurisdiction. In practice, the ruling struck down legislation that would have allowed Arizona state and municipal police to arrest without warrant anyone that they suspected of being an illegal immigrant - a dangerously mean-spirited law that would have led without question to the racial profiling of Latinos. Police in Arizona will still be allowed to check the immigration status of people arrested for other reasons, but even that is now on the Supreme Court's radar and will most likely face a similar fate once it works its way into the court system.</p><p>This is by no means the end of the debate, especially in an election year. There is much political capital to be won in the U.S. both in advocating a merciless zero-tolerance policy on illegal immigration and in taking a more nuanced position that seeks reform in a measured fashion. Monday's ruling fits more in the latter camp. As such, it is a victory for President Barack Obama, who this month announced a new policy that will allow as many as 800,000 young illegal immigrants to stay in the U.S.; and it is a clear signal to Mitt Romney, Mr. Obama's Republican opponent, that his support for rogue states that want to diverge from the Administration's policies and wield a heavy hand, not to say police baton, has passed its best-before date.</p><p>What is needed now from both candidates are clearly stated policies on broad immigration reform and a vow to end piecemeal fixes - whether these come from the White House or from state legislatures - that are politically motivated. It is time for Congress to fulfill its responsibilities.</p>, <p>When Caterpillar closed a plant in Southern Ontario last week and threw 450 people out of work, some commentators treated it like a national catastrophe. Caterpillar, which is notorious for its hardball labour tactics, plans to relocate the jobs in Indiana, where people are willing to work for half of what the unionized workers in Ontario got.</p><p>I felt awful for the workers. Who wouldn't? But Ontario has to compete with the entire world. And even if those jobs don't move away, many are being swept away by new technology. The mighty engine of Confederation has turned into its rust belt. But nobody in the rest of Canada is feeling particularly sorry for us. We squandered the fat years on a vast expansion of our government and threw away our money on foolish green energy schemes. Now we face a gloomy decade of tax increases, deteriorating health care and deep cuts to everything. Did I mention that the average detached house in Toronto costs $606,000?</p><p>No wonder Ontarians are so depressed. No wonder so many of my friends' kids are moving away to Edmonton, Calgary and Vancouver. These are the same places their parents were eager to escape 30 or 40 years ago. Back then, Toronto was the place to be if you wanted to make something of yourself. Today, it's the West.</p><p>The country's economic, demographic and political power are all shifting. Western power has already begun to change our national values. Stephen Harper's majority was no fluke. He was elected by a new coalition of westerners and voters in the suburbs of Toronto. These people prefer CTV to the CBC. They think Ottawa and government should matter less, and they seldom think about Quebec at all. This is an epochal shift. Quebec's threats and aspirations dominated (and paralyzed) national affairs for the better part of a generation. Today, people no longer ask what it will take to keep Quebec happy. Instead, they ask why Quebec is getting billions in equalization payments so it can subsidize $7-a-day daycare.</p><p>Quebec is hurtling toward the bottom of the country in income and standard of living. Alberta and Saskatchewan are at the other end. Natural resources play a part in that, but so do values. Quebeckers work fewer hours and make less money than other Canadians, but pay far higher taxes. The oil sands are extremely unpopular in Quebec. And even though Quebec has bountiful resources of its own, Quebeckers don't want to develop them. They'd rather impose carbon taxes and oppose pipelines.</p><p>Like it or not, Canada's stupendous natural resources are our future. They are the envy of the world, and will ensure our prosperity for many years to come. Most Canadians already get this, and the western shift means their voices will become increasingly important. The question is not whether we should develop these resources, but how wisely and how well.</p><p>Environmental romantics who think resource extraction is inherently immoral might want to take a look at Newfoundland. A few years ago, it was dying. It had the lowest education levels and incomes in the country, and young people were leaving by the thousands. Oil has transformed Newfoundland into a modern, vibrant economy where people's kids have a future. The same thing happened in Saskatchewan. Oil has turned Norway into the most prosperous and socially equal country on the planet. Its environment is remarkably unspoiled. And its oil industry has created high-skilled, high-tech jobs and cutting-edge technologies that are in demand around the world.</p><p>Like the Newfoundlanders who used to fish for cod, the people who used to make $32 an hour at Caterpillar are out of luck. But their kids have better prospects. Unlike manufacturing jobs, natural resources can't be relocated to Indiana or China. Some of the kids from Canada's rust belt will get degrees in metallurgy or engineering and move to Edmonton or Saskatoon (or St. John's). They will discover that people in those places are a lot more optimistic than people around here. If I were a few years younger, I might move there myself.</p><p>Census 2011 interactives: Explore the numbers</p>, <p>The shopping-mall tragedy in Elliot Lake, Ont., got a dose of irony Tuesday when Stephen Harper's office announced that the Prime Minister was willing to send in emergency assistance.</p><p>That would be a noble gesture - if the Conservative majority in the Senate weren't about to approve the omnibus budget bill that will kill federal assistance to front-line emergency relief teams across Canada, including the Toronto-based Heavy Urban Search and Rescue Unit (HUSAR), currently on the scene in Elliot Lake.</p><p>If the federal government does find a way to help in Elliot Lake, God bless it. Alternately, God may wish to damn the government for shutting down its contribution to a co-operative federal-provincial-territorial program meant to ensure that Canadians across the country have access to competent, timely assistance at times like this.</p><p>The Joint Emergency Preparedness Program was established in 1980 to create infrastructure and provide equipment for front-line emergency workers. The five HUSAR units, located in large cities across the country, are meant to ensure that help gets to communities like Elliot Lake in a hurry. The Canadian Emergency Management College in Ottawa offers invaluable classroom and field training to emergency workers. Federal funding is being withdrawn from all of them.</p><p>Canada has suffered countless disasters since Confederation, and these joint programs recognized that response capacity has been fragmented across the country, without a clear definition of the roles of various branches of government or the necessary resources to respond, particularly in small towns and rural areas.</p><p>The federal government has invested more than $170-million in these joint programs. In its 2008 report Emergency Preparedness In Canada, the Senate committee on national security and defence argued that even more funding and sophisticated co-ordination were required, with Ottawa taking the lead. Instead, the Harper government is abandoning the field. It argues that, in terms of providing equipment, 'the objectives of the program have been met.' That statement is laughable, if one can laugh through tears. Equipment is in constant need of upgrading.</p><p>When Vancouver fire chief John McKearney heard that the city's HUSAR unit was being stripped of federal funding, he declared himself 'shell-shocked.' The Vancouver team provided valuable assistance in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina in 2005, and the chief argues that it needs continued federal support if it's to be ready for earthquakes in B.C.</p><p>These cuts fit nicely into the Harper government's belief that the provinces' constitutional responsibilities should be funded by the provinces alone. Why that mantra applies to emergency relief when it doesn't apply in areas like education and justice is a question Canadians should be asking. When a person who matters to you is lying under a heap of rubble, waiting for rescue, you need help from whomever can best provide it. In most cases, the best response is a well co-ordinated effort with every possible level of government involved.</p><p>Elliot Lake is not an isolated incident. Think about 1987 (Edmonton tornado), 1996 (Saguenay River floods), 1997 (Red River floods), 1998 (ice storms in Eastern Canada), 2003 (SARS epidemic in Toronto, power blackout in Ontario and Hurricane Juan in Nova Scotia). The list goes on.</p><p>The HUSAR squad's arrival in Elliot Lake on Monday may well not end up saving a single life. But how reckless is Ottawa's gamble that federal support won't be crucial in all the disasters to come?</p><p>Colin Kenny is former chair of the Senate committee on national security and defence.</p>, <p>The voters of Quebec need to concentrate their minds on which of the three major political parties is most likely to advance their long-term economic interests - and the least likely to entangle them deeper in identity politics.</p><p>Quebec has by far the largest public debt among the provinces of Canada; at almost $253-billion, it is 51 per cent of GDP, much worse than Ontario (in second place at 37 per cent). The budget deficit is comparatively healthy, at 1 per cent of GDP, and current government spending is fairly stable. But the overall debt of the broader public sector, for which the government and the taxpayers are ultimately responsible, including Hydro-Quebec and other corporations (about $42-billion) and municipalities (nearly $22-billion), will keep growing, even if budgetary balance is achieved.</p><p>All three parties, though with varying emphases, place great hope in Quebec's development of natural resources in its northern region. But world demand for minerals is clearly down, and likely to remain so, for the life of the next government.</p><p>Moreover, Quebec has not adequately modernized the public sector's contracting with the private sector. Patronage is still common; bribery and corruption persist. Without vigorous reform, revenues will be wasted, and infrastructure will quickly depreciate.</p><p>The students' strike, which paralyzed parts of Montreal for weeks in the spring, showed the difficulty, in Quebec's all-too-distinct political culture, of enhancing non-tax revenues, and of funding education that will make Quebec's young people productive participants in an increasingly high-technology world - the universities' debt is another $2-billion.</p><p>With a birth rate of about 11 per cent, Quebec, like Canada as a whole, needs skilled immigrants to maintain and enhance its labour force. (Low-cost daycare has done little to help the population grow.) Shrill debates about 'reasonable accommodation' - and convoluted proposals meant to appeal to Quebecois nationalism - communicate intolerance. If Quebec acquires a reputation for not welcoming people from abroad, it will fall further behind.</p><p>That is the danger that Quebeckers face on several fronts. If the province does not embrace innovation, it will decline, relatively and absolutely. On Sept. 4, the electors should recognize that business as usual is not a viable choice.</p>, <p>Contrary to popular belief, Vancouver did have a plan for last spring's run to the Stanley Cup finals by the local Canuckleheads.</p><p>The plan may have been only three words long, but 'Come on down!' was endorsed by all and sundry - city council, police, merchants, media and thousands of Slurpee-sated fans who massed downtown to watch left winger Tanner Glass on the big, outdoor screen. No one expected a riot when Mr. Glass failed to score.</p><p>This year will be different. Already, the Canucks have done their part. Tanner is now freezing his Glass off in Winnipeg.</p><p>Now, after long deliberation, with the Stanley Cup parade a mere two and a half months distant, the city has finally unveiled its own anti-mayhem contribution.</p><p>Rioters, I want to say one word to you. Just one word. CLEOC.</p><p>Yes, the City Large Event Oversight Committee has your number, ready to shunt you off to a community centre ball hockey game at the least sign of trouble.</p><p>That's not all. CLEOC has also assembled a truly terrifying team of other formidable acronyms to ensure that never again will anyone torch an SUV in front of the PO in broad daylight (PDT) with the VPD standing by.</p><p>These riot-prevention partners, listed on page 13 of the city's plan, include BCAS, DVBIA, E-COMM, PNE, VCH, VFRS and VPD, with the added assistance of STAC, chaired by PNE CEO.</p><p>If those initials aren't enough to scare the hoodies off the hoodlums, the next page warns that CLEOC's 'risk assessment framework' is based on best practices developed by FEMA in the USA.</p><p>So the next time Vision councillor Heather Deal exults, 'We ROCK at this!' as she did a few hours before the first car went up in flames last June, be advised that Ms. Deal is actually referring to the most powerful weapon of all in the city's acronym quiver: 'Rioters Ordered to Cease Kerfuffles.'</p><p>No more LOL, man.</p><p>****</p><p>Polling can be a quirky business. Ask respondents whether they support abortion on demand, and they tend to say no. Ask them if they believe abortion is best left to a woman and her doctor, and they tend to say yes. Yet both essentially amount to the same thing: freedom of choice.</p><p>So it is with the emotional issue of the proposed Northern Gateway pipeline to carry Alberta crude oil across B.C. to the port of Kitimat, and thence by supertanker to markets in Asia.</p><p>A recent Mustel Group poll asked British Columbians if they generally supported the pipeline project. The question did not mention the need for oil supertankers. The result? A slight majority (50.1 per cent) came out in favour of the pipeline.</p><p>At about the same time, a number of environmental groups commissioned a poll on the same Gateway proposal from Justason Market Intelligence.</p><p>But this one asked respondents: 'Do you support or oppose allowing crude oil supertankers through B.C.'s inside coastal waters?'</p><p>The outcome was dramatically different. Fully 66 per cent said they were against the presence of supertankers, compared with only 22 per cent who supported the plan.</p><p>Given these widely differing results, depending on the question, no wonder Gateway proponents tend to concentrate on the pipeline itself, and downplay the need for those great, big, huge, ungainly oil supertankers.</p><p>****</p><p>You probably didn't know this, but March 11 was World Plumbing Day. Word finally leaked out in Vancouver this week, when Mayor Gregor Robertson belatedly read out the proclamation to flushed members of council.

Right you are, mayor.</p><p>***</p><p>The feds' tough-on-crime guy, Public Safety Minister Vic Toews, was in town last week to join B.C.'s not-quite-so-tough-on-crime lady, Justice Minister Shirley Bond, for the inking of a new contract to keep the Mounties hitched to their horses in the province for the next 20 years.</p><p>Mr. Toews and his prominent white moustache were introduced by local Conservative MP Nina Grewal.

Those who forgot to bring a towel had to rent one, as the Olympic organizers decided they could not afford to provide a free one to athletes.</p><p>'We lived like the troops,' said Dr. McGeer, now 85, a physician and prominent medical researcher.</p><p>What the hosts could not provide in material goods they made up for in bonhomie.</p><p>'The Brits couldn't have been more welcoming,' he said. 'They were high-spirited. They were open-armed to the world.

The Montreal players did not attend.</p><p>The Montreal players were feted at a luncheon at Maccabi House.

The indoor lighting was poor, the preliminary matches poorly attended. A carpenter waited on the sidelines to fix a temporary wood floor in constant need of repair.</p><p>Despite their differences, the Canadian team finished the opening round with a record of three wins and two losses, one of those by a single point. They anticipated moving on to the medal round, only to learn they had been relegated to also-ran status. Ties in the standings were settled by point differential and the Canadians, ignorant of this, had neglected to run up the score against weak opponents such as the host British team.</p><p>The Canadians then rolled to three easy victories to finish in ninth place, a bittersweet consolation.</p><p>The Olympic tournament, won handily by the Americans, featured teams from 23 nations, helping to make basketball an international sport in the years after the war.</p><p>On his return, Dr. McGeer did postgraduate studies at Princeton University, becoming with his wife Dr. Edith McGeer a leading authority on Alzheimer's disease. He also launched a political career in British Columbia that saw him serve as a cabinet minister in Social Credit governments.</p><p>Mr. Tolchinsky, who at 6-foot-4 was the tallest player on the Canadian Olympic squad, returned to Montreal, where his basketball skills eased his entry into McGill University. He met a young actor there named William Shatner who encouraged him to write musical comedies for the Red and White Revue. (Such talent runs in the Tolchinsky family.

According to a report from the Institute of Medicine, that includes $750-billion that is squandered on over-treatment, byzantine paperwork, fraud and other wasteful habits.</p><p>In essence, 30 per cent of health-care dollars are frittered away.</p><p>Unnecessary care, $210-billion: Over-treatment has reached epidemic proportions in the profit-driven U.S. system; there is much truth to the stereotype that patients with a headache and good insurance get MRIs.</p><p>Excessive administration, $190-billion: Cataloguing expenses and multiple insurance plans makes lots of paperwork.</p><p>Inefficient delivery of care, $130-billion: Administration is not centralized, so patients get shuffled among specialists and facilities, with much overlap.</p><p>Inflated prices, $105-billion: An appendectomy can cost $1,529 to $182,955, depending on where it is performed. Unlike other countries that depend on private providers and insurance, the U.S. has very little price regulation.</p><p> </p><p>Fraud, $75-billion: Health care involves so much money that it attracts crime; common fraudulent practices include providers that double-bill, suppliers that don't deliver and patients who cheat on their insurance.</p><p> </p><p>Prevention failures, $55-billion: A common example is diabetics who have to have limbs amputated because they couldn't afford medication.</p><p>(The total does not equal $750-billion because some categories overlap.)</p><p>And that's just the money.</p><p>The IOM estimates that poor-quality care - specifically the lack of standards that leads to huge variations in treatment -causes about 75,000 premature deaths a year.</p><p>Canada has had no similar analysis. We could certainly use a reality check.</p><p>We like to pretend that in our 'socialist' medicare system everything is done for the greater good, so over-treatment, inefficiency, price inflation and fraud are non-existent. That's a costly delusion.</p><p>Yes, the U.S. system encourages over-treatment.</p><p>The only area where Canada's medicare system is clearly better is administrative costs. Officially, our administrative costs are 3.5 per cent of health spending, compared to about 30 per cent in the United States, but most are hidden in other categories and, if anything, our system is under-managed. So Canada, like the United States, has few checks and balances and tends to reward volume rather than innovation and results. That's why many costly inefficiencies are ingrained.</p><p>The IOM has put the failures into context through some easy-to-understand analogies. To wit:</p><p>If banking were like health care, automated transactions would take days rather than seconds because of unavailable or misplaced records.</p><p>If home building were like health care, carpenters, electricians and plumbers would work from different blueprints, with very little co-ordination.</p><p>If shopping were like health-care, prices would not be posted and would vary widely within the same store.</p><p>If automobile manufacturing were like health care, there would be no warranties for cars and therefore no incentive to monitor and improve performance and product quality.</p><p>If airline travel were like health care, each pilot would be free to design his or her own pre-flight safety check, or not perform one.</p><p>What is noteworthy is these analogies apply to Canada, too.</p><p>So too do the basic messages, which are ultimately more important than the dollar figures.</p><p>The IOM notes that the past half century has had dramatic biomedical advances, from drug therapies to surgical procedures, and many diagnoses that were once a death sentence (like cancer) are now chronic health problems, with both the benefits and challenges that entails.</p><p>The paradox is that comparable progress has not come on the management side and 'health care is falling short on basic dimensions of quality, outcomes, cost and equity.'</p><p>The report is a not-so-subtle plea to get back to basics, to dispense with the wasteful and counterproductive attitude that, in medicine, more is better, and to remember the ultimate purpose of a health-care system - to help people stay well and give them care when it's needed, with the goal of improving the health of the population and, ultimately, the economy. Health care should not be an economic drain.</p><p>Ultimately, the IOM's message is hopeful because it reminds us that we can have both better and cheaper care.</p><p>Yet, doing what is best - for patients, for the health system, for the taxpayer - is not going to be easy because many vested interests profit handsomely from the status quo.</p><p>As the IOM report concludes, we know what needs to be done to rein in health spending and improve the quality of health care, and we can do it; however, the actions required 'will be notable, substantial, sometimes disruptive - and absolutely necessary.'</p>, <p>Belay, me hearties! Welcome aboard the good ship Collected Wisdom. We're about to receive a gun salute from a sister ship of the line. Funny, though, those cannons seem to be pointing right at us.</p><p>The question</p><p>What is the origin of the 21-gun salute? asksJohn Yorke of New Glasgow, N.S.</p><p>The answer</p><p>Richard Gimblett, acting director of navy history and heritage for the Department of National Defence, suggested that we consultThe Oxford Companion to Ships and the Sea. He didn't steer us wrong.</p><p>Gun salutes, the book says, started as a naval tradition whereby one ship would pay its respects to another. These salutes 'were fired on every possible occasion and were often unlimited in extent, largely due to a predilection of naval officers of all nations for loud and prolonged noise, and it was not until 1675 that regulations were introduced in Britain, quickly followed by all other maritime nations, limiting the number of guns to be fired,' it says.</p><p>It points out that the number of salutes was curtailed to stop a considerable waste of gunpowder.</p><p>'Samuel Pepys, secretary of the British Admiralty, worked out a scale based on a minimum salute of three guns up to 19 guns for the admiral of the fleet. Two more guns were added for a salute to the monarch, and a royal or presidential salute still remains at 21 guns.'</p><p>The odd numbers for salutes were chosen, it says, because even numbers were fired at naval funerals as a sign of mourning for the dead officer.</p><p>Further notice</p><p>Here's a historical postscript to an item we published a while ago about how water stored in towers for steam locomotives was kept from freezing in winter.

His dad, Edmour Gauthier, was a pump man. His job was to feed coal into a boiler that created steam to run the pump that filled the water tank. This tank served as water supply to the village as well as the locomotives.</p><p>'His memory of the tank was that it was heated by a coal-oil lamp. One time, the lamp fell over, starting a fire in the wooden casing. Fortunately, it was extinguished before too much damage was done.

Both were invited by the mayor's staff.</p><p>The Twitter session was billed by the mayor's office as an opportunity to 'let people who aren't normally engaged in city politics weigh in on what they care about - it brings the current issues at City Hall to an entirely different audience.'</p><p>But it's also a way for civic leaders to communicate with constituents safely - with the ability to pick and choose questions, and without the media weighing in and holding politicians accountable with little irritants such as context and fact-checks.</p><p>Don't get me wrong.

And some not-so-tough questions, for instance 'How is your cat?'</p><p>But the mayor opted to answer a question from one of his host-tweeters first: @VIAwesome: 'Gregor, which do you like better, playoff beard or a #Movember moustache?'</p><p>@MayorGregor says playoff beard! #gocanucks Then, ignoring those questions about arts funding, 'no fun city,' the Rio, and the average family's struggle with affordability, the mayor moved on to the cat. 'My rescue cat 'Kitty' is doing great. Thanks for asking a great question.'</p><p>Sarcasm? Maybe. It's hard to tell on Twitter.</p><p>For the next hour, Mr. Robertson fielded questions about food carts and bike share programs, affordability, building heights, liquor laws and whether he felt the depth provided by Zack Kassian and Marc-Andre Gragnani will be enough to help the Canucks in the postseason.</p><p>On bike shares - yes, Vancouver will experiment with a pilot program during this summer's Velo-City conference. On affordability, 'a national housing strategy would be a big help.' The mayor says the city will continue to 'push for updates to the many outdated liquor laws that need fixing.' And while Mr. Robertson remained silent on the value of the two former Buffalo Sabres at playoff time, he did comment on the Canucks' goaltending: 'Schneider is a keeper! #gocanucks'</p><p>Halfway through the exercise #GregorLive became the top trending topic in Vancouver, then made the leap to trending nationally. Mission accomplished.</p><p>There were some serious and pretty specific questions. For instance, 'Why aren't sexually exploited women a higher priority in our city?' 'Why was the director of emergency management let go last month?' 'What was the full cost of the Cities Summit?' And 'Why the increase in no-bid contracts in 2011?' Granted, some of these questions came from reporters, who were apparently unaware of the 'light and celebratory' intent of the exercise.</p><p>These were questions that if asked in a media scrum, the mayor would have had to answer, or would have risked being seen evading them on the nightly news.</p><p>In the Twitterverse, those questions dissolve into vapour. So what was billed as meaningful public engagement really feels more like public relations.</p><p>At the end of the hour the mayor came off as a regular guy, with his Canucks jersey and his rescue cat.</p><p>Oh, and #gocanucks.</p><p>Stephen Quinn ( @cbcstephenquinn) is the host of On the Coast on CBC Radio One, 88.1 FM and 690 in Vancouver.</p>, <p>For those who worshipped last winter at the temple of Don Drummond, the news is bleak.</p><p>Seven months after the release of the former bank economist's much-hyped report on how to fix Ontario's finances, Premier Dalton McGuinty - who commissioned the report and once acted as though it would provide all the answers to the province's woes - has clearly lost the faith.</p><p>Mr. McGuinty's Liberals never fully bought into some of the more controversial of the report's 362 recommendations, such as scrapping full-day kindergarten, and fair enough; it wasn't a checklist. But this week, as they announced a cap on the salaries of public-sector executives and a lengthy freeze of their pay-for-performance - aimed mostly at making it easier to freeze the salaries of unionized workers - it was obvious that the Liberals have rejected one of Mr. Drummond's central premises.</p><p>Central to his prescription was avoiding 'short-term fixes' and 'across-the-board cuts,' which allow structural problems to fester. 'We must be students of history and history shows that simple cost-cutting by governments too often generates fiscal improvements that peter out after a few years as pressures build,' Mr. Drummond wrote in his introductory letter. 'In the end, spending surges again and the result is more of the same, but at a higher cost.'</p><p>No section of the report was more explicit on this front than the one on labour costs, which account for the bulk of government's expenditures. 'Wage freezes are often followed by wage catch-up periods,' the report says. 'Such action, if undertaken in the current fiscal climate, would undermine our longer-term fiscal mandate and damage labour relations.'</p><p>The government, Mr. Drummond argued, should instead pursue more thoughtful ways of improving public-sector productivity and efficiency. Among the mechanisms he highlighted was tying pay to performance, notably for senior executives.</p><p>Unlike the province's two opposition parties, the Liberals initially seemed to be on board with most of this. They rejected the Progressive Conservatives' call for a sweeping wage freeze for the reasons Mr. Drummond articulated, and privately mocked the NDP's populist demand for a crackdown on the earnings of people running hospitals or power utilities.</p><p>That was then. Now, the government is much closer to the opposition parties on these issues than it is to Mr. Drummond. The spin from the Liberals is that Mr. Drummond himself said that if some of his proposed cost-cutting measures weren't adopted, others had to replace them - so if they're going to keep full-day kindergarten and low primary-school class sizes, something had to give.</p><p>Considering that few people in government actually believe it's an exact science, with Mr. Drummond's suggestions adding up to the exact savings needed to get out of deficit, a more credible explanation is political pressure. In a minority legislature, the Liberals need opposition support to get stuff done; they also feel the need to show the public they're moving decisively. So grand gestures have a certain appeal.</p><p>There is perhaps something more fundamental as well. For all that its grim economic forecasts and deficit projections caused Mr. Drummond's report to be portrayed as apocalyptic, in another sense it was highly optimistic. It argued that if existing structures were challenged, if the right questions were asked about why things were done and if they could be done better, the public sector could be transformed in ways governments had long talked about but never achieved.</p><p>The reason they've never achieved it is that such transformation is really, really hard. For a brief time, Mr. McGuinty seemed to have a stomach for it, and in fairness some related measures were introduced in the spring budget. But in the current political climate, what are the odds of a nine-year-old government fighting for its survival having the discipline to play the long game?</p><p>Mr. Drummond's report still serves as a useful catalogue of cost-cutting options. Its brief time as the guiding orthodoxy at Queen's Park, however, has come and gone.</p>, <p>Thursday's announcement that the Canadian International Development Agency will be folded into the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade leaves critical questions about Canada's aid policy unanswered.</p><p>First, regardless of whether aid policy is run from CIDA or a new mega-ministry, will our development spending prioritize the reduction of poverty or the promotion of Canadian commercial interests? Ottawa has recently pushed for the latter. In November, International Development Minister Julian Fantino signalled that Canadian aid policy would place greater emphasis on partnerships with the private sector and working to promote Canadian interests abroad.</p><p>There is nothing wrong with public-private partnerships in development. On the contrary, creating conditions for sustainable, market-driven growth in developing societies seems to be the single best remedy for poverty. Whether such partnerships should be geared towards advancing Canadian commercial interests, however, is a different question. Canada already has an export development agency and a trade commissioner service. Our international trade minister has been working energetically to open new markets for our firms and investors. Canada's engagement in Africa, for instance, including recent trips by both the trade minister and the Prime Minister, has increasingly focused on creating opportunities for Canadian extractive industries. Given all of these efforts to promote Canadian economic interests abroad, would it not make sense to dedicate our aid spending to projects that have the greatest chance of sustainably reducing poverty, even if they do not benefit Canadian companies?</p><p>Second, will there be greater stability or consistency in our aid policy under the new arrangements? Development assistance requires long-term commitments to projects and countries. Yet, Canadian governments of all political stripes have reinvented our 'long term' aid priorities every few years. Most recently, the Conservatives announced in 2009 that, in the interests of maximizing the effectiveness of Canadian development assistance, spending would concentrate on 20 'countries of focus.' Now, however, the concept of focus countries may be falling out of favour . The most consistent feature of Canadian aid policy has been its inconsistency. Will folding CIDA into DFAIT do anything to remedy this problem?</p><p>Third, will the process of integrating the two departments divert them from their primary work? Last decade's separation and subsequent reunification of the foreign affairs and international trade halves of DFAIT were demoralizing distractions. Integrating CIDA and DFAIT will involve more than just relocating personnel. Potentially divisive issues will need to be resolved: How will the new mega-department recognize and preserve the expertise in development? Although governments have the undisputed right to set their own policy priorities, how will individual decisions on aid spending be protected from excessive politicization? How will the three ministers work together? And how will these new arrangements remedy, rather than worsen, the already-acute delays in decision-making in the offices of both the foreign minister and the international development minister?</p><p>Merging CIDA and DFAIT is not a bad idea in itself, nor is it novel: CIDA started its life as a part of DFAIT and several other countries have integrated their foreign affairs and international development ministries. As we have learned many times, however, the process of bureaucratic reorganization can solve some problems but create new ones - particularly when fundamental questions of policy remain unresolved.</p><p>Roland Paris is University Research Chair in International Security and Governance at the University of Ottawa, founding Director of the Centre for International Policy Studies.</p>, <p>Premier Christy Clark sanctioned personal attacks on her critics this week, saying she will not muzzle her MLAs. In fact, she suggested it can be a winning strategy at the polls.</p><p>By allowing the intemperate remarks of BC Liberals Harry Bloy and Kevin Krueger to go unchecked, she has effectively unleashed the pit bulls.</p><p>It's a well-used tactic. The party leader keeps his or her hands clean, delegating the mudslinging to others. With all the dirt flying in the B.C. Legislature in recent weeks, however, some of it is going to end up on the Premier.</p><p>This week, Mr. Krueger called NDP Leader Adrian Dix a cheater who has demonstrated a pattern of dishonesty. But it is not just the New Democrats who are bleeding support from the BC Liberals these days, and he saved his greatest vitriol for MLA John van Dongen, who quit the BC Liberals to represent the BC Conservatives. A man with a 'really nasty streak' and no integrity, he said. Then he went into details.</p><p>'I would have expressed that differently,' Ms. Clark said when asked by reporters about Mr. Krueger's 10-minute rant to reporters.</p><p>Ms. Clark, however, described Mr. Krueger as a passionate man whose refusal to adhere to political correctness has been validated by voters at the polls. She won't put a cork in it. 'On the BC Liberal side of the House, MLAs express their views about things. In my government, that is not an unacceptable thing.'</p><p>That principle had already been tested last month when Mr. Bloy launched his own attack on Mr. Dix, accusing the opposition leader of fraud and theft, with a hefty dose of innuendo. Mr. Bloy did apologize, and the Premier later said he was wrong to make those comments. But there was no reprimand.</p><p>Not everyone has embraced the ethos that going negative works. Mr. Dix has repeatedly vowed that he - and his party - won't engage in personal attacks. Old habits die hard, however, and NDP House Leader John Horgan admitted in an interview on Thursday that he himself struggles to keep onside of his leader's edict.</p><p>'There are opportunities to be negative and Adrian fastidiously says, 'No, we're not doing that.' I have a tendency, as you know, I can get [worked up] as well and I'm trying my level best to follow that leadership.' The NDP Leader argues that negative attacks turn voters off.</p><p>Not surprisingly, Mr. Horgan thinks Ms. Clark should have shown disapproval for her MLAs' conduct. But closer to home, Ms. Clark's approach can be contrasted with the response of her own deputy premier, Kevin Falcon. 'I don't believe nasty is necessary,' Mr. Falcon told reporters last month when asked about Mr. Bloy's commentary. 'I would not do that.' Mr. Falcon is as prepared to throw down the gloves as any politician in the B.C. Legislature today, but he took pains to say those exchanges should be limited to ideological differences.</p><p>Angus Reid pollster Mario Canseco thinks the BC Liberals would be wise to avoid going negative as they fight to climb their way back up the polls. Attack ads are best deployed by parties that are ahead and have a base of support to hold onto, he said. 'If anything, Dix's approval has improved after the BC Liberals launched their [attack]ads. When the base is eroding - and this is evident, as they have lost half of their 2009 voters to other parties - the negative ads only serve to reinforce some of the unfavourable features that the public has already absorbed about the BC Liberals.'</p><p>Ms. Clark is not persuaded. She notes that Mr. Krueger - who has earned a reputation for blunt talk - has been an electoral success in a bellwether riding.</p><p>'The people of Kamloops have elected Kevin Krueger every time since 1996,' she said. 'My guess is, the people of Kamloops think the fact that he says what he thinks and doesn't worry about political correctness all the time, is something that appeals to them.'</p><p>Buffer seat</p><p>Opposing members of the B.C.

Or are they unimaginatively hoarding cash? Early in August, a C.D. Howe Institute report announced that new capital investment per Canadian worker in 2012 will likely surpass other developed countries - our best performance for decades. But toward month-end, Bank of Canada Governor Mark Carney and federal Finance Minister Jim Flaherty accentuated the negative. Mr. Carney talked about 'dead money' that managers at a loss for opportunities should return to shareholders.</p><p>Good - we agree that more capital investment would be better. As for getting there, though - is business over-saving really the problem?</p><p>For years, the C.D. Howe Institute has compared per-worker spending on non-residential structures and equipment in Canada and abroad using measures that adjust for different purchasing power of different currencies. For years, those comparisons were bleak. In the early 2000s, for example, our businesses invested about 6 per cent less per worker than the average across OECD countries, and more than 20 per cent less than U.S. businesses.</p><p>Since then, we've raised our game. As the decade progressed, our businesses closed the gap against the OECD, and cut the gap against the U.S. in half. This year, we estimated that - at more than $12,000 in new capital per worker - Canada's tally will be 5 per cent higher than the OECD average. Last Friday's news of 9-per cent-plus annualized growth (inflation-adjusted) in non-residential investment suggests we are on track to hit that mark.</p><p>Why are our businesses not doing still more? Partly because they have been shoring up their balance sheets post-2008. Earlier at the event where he talked about 'dead money,' Mr. Carney praised Canadian banks for bolstering their capital. With the world economy slowing and a fiscal and currency crisis looming in Europe, financial and non-financial firms alike are wary of getting overextended. Businesses abroad are retrenching even more - one reason why Canadian investment is pulling ahead.</p><p>Because fewer Canadians lost their jobs during the slump and more found work afterward than their less fortunate counterparts abroad, moreover, the institute's per-worker tally mutes Canada's recent improvement. On the whole, Canadians - Mr. Carney and Mr. Flaherty among them - should take satisfaction that credible monetary policy and growth-friendly tax and regulatory changes seem to be moving Canada up the scale of countries where businesses want to invest, and where workers can look forward to better, higher-paying jobs.</p><p>One interpretation of Mr. Carney's comments would be that, with healthier banks behind them, Canadian businesses don't need to self-insure. But another, certainly more widespread, take was that he and Mr. Flaherty were dissing business - and, as spun by some - repudiating the policies that support it. Before concluding that businesses should cough up cash they're too dumb or lazy to use, or that we should tax and spend it for them, let's see what recent flows of saving and investment in the Canadian economy reveal about what else is happening.</p><p>Historically, Canadian businesses tended to borrow funds to cover capital investments they couldn't finance internally. Lately, however, businesses are emitting funds. Statistics Canada's latest figures also show that over the year to mid-2012, they not only added about $12,000 of new capital per worker, they also released about $3,500 per worker in saving. They are already distributing money - and the popping share prices of some that recently hiked their dividends show that investors like it when they do.</p><p>What is going on? Canadian households were historically net lenders. Now they are big borrowers. As individuals and families, we spent some $8,000 per worker - essentially all on residential construction - over that period. But we had only $5,500 per worker of household resources to finance it. So we borrowed a further $2,500 per worker to finance what looks a lot like a housing bubble. There's 'dead money'!</p><p>Meanwhile, the deficits of Canadian governments absorbed more than $3,500 per worker. The net result was not a glut of saving, but a shortage. To balance things, we borrowed more than $2,500 per worker from foreigners - who, by buying government bonds, raise the value of the dollar and dull the competitive edge of some businesses that might otherwise invest even more.</p><p>So yes, we could do better. But the much-touted 'Canadian advantage' is already stimulating business investment: Our workers are now getting more new plant and equipment than their counterparts abroad. We don't want businesses to save less. We want households and governments to save more.</p><p>William Robson is president and CEO of the C.D. Howe Institute.</p>, <p>An off-the-cuff remark made in Toronto last week to more than 600 food industry experts by Galen Weston, executive chairman of Loblaw Cos. Ltd., sparked outrage in farmers' market circles. 'Farmers' markets are great ... One day they're going to kill some people, though,' he said, quickly adding: 'I'm just saying that to be dramatic, though.'</p><p>A shocking comment, perhaps, but the fact of the matter is, it may have already happened. Consumers can contract food-borne illnesses anywhere, including from the stores of supermarket giants such as Loblaws. Such is the reality of food systems. Yes, they were strong words from the head of Canada's largest food retailer, but they point out that a broader, more rational debate on food safety is warranted in our country.</p><p>The 2003 mad cow crisis in Canada was really the first major food safety-related event our country had experienced. Although domestic demand for beef went up more than 5 per cent the year after the crisis began, it arguably became more of a trade issue than a food safety one. Some safety regulations did change, mostly on the primary production side.</p><p>ThenE. coli, botulism and salmonella came, which progressively led us to Maple Leaf Foods and the tainted deli-meat crisis of 2008. Maple Leaf's recall changed the psyche of many Canadians on how we manage risks as a country. In the past, we blamed Britain, Mexico and the United States, since many recalled products came from abroad. This time, it was a truly Canadian brand harming fellow Canadians, and it hit our Canadian identity to the core. To cope, many investigations were launched and task forces formed. As a result, several public health and food safety regulations were altered.</p><p>As a country, we spent millions making our food safety systems more robust, while survey after survey suggests that Canadians trust the safety of our foodstuff. What most Canadians don't know is that most of the regulations were unintentionally projected to the larger players within the food industry. Maple Leaf, Loblaws and other food processors and distributors have become astute risk managers. Meantime, smaller food businesses are challenged by the extent of new food safety regulations, including those selling foods at farmers' markets.</p><p>The Canadian Food Inspection Agency spends more than $350-million on food safety a year - that's $10 for every Canadian - excluding efforts from the provinces and municipalities. We've never had a public dialogue on the proper threshold for public expenditure related to food safety surveillance.</p><p>For industry, particularly for smaller enterprises trying to develop new markets both domestically and globally, the role of the Canadian food safety regulatory regime has become somewhat of an impediment to innovation and successful commercialization. The overall regulatory and policy framework within which the Canadian food industry operates itself interferes with our ability to effectively support industry in innovation, marketing and commercialization. Most Canadians wouldn't know how difficult it really is to start a business in the food industry, mostly as a result of the array of food safety policies.</p><p>In food safety, the era in which crises dictate how we regulate should end. Since governments are continuously challenged by budgetary shortfalls, what's needed is a more strategic approach on how we make the food industry more accountable to Canadians. We have the science, but more collaboration is warranted. One scenario would be to compel the larger, more resourceful companies to support the smaller ones. This is already happening, but such practices should be encouraged by regulators. Another option would be to customize regulations for smaller outfits without compromising the health of consumers.</p><p>We also need to celebrate our successes in food safety. The mere fact that the 2008 Maple Leaf listeria outbreak was discovered early is an achievement in itself. Many food safety experts still believe that we may have had one major outbreak before, but it went undetected. In the past, systems were not equipped to detect the scope and scale of these outbreaks. Regulatory changes stemming from the 2003 SARS outbreak allowed public health officials to recognize the problem early on. And the Maple Leaf affair allowed us to educate ourselves on what was then considered a relatively unknown pathogen.</p><p>Sylvain Charlebois is acting dean and professor at the University of Guelph's College of Management and Economics.</p>, <p>The servers at Auberge du Pommier, the Oliver and Bonacini company's romantic and, at nearly 25 years old now, blissfully old-fashioned North Toronto room, wear black ties and black vests and speak with the sort of deference that's been all but abandoned in modern dining.Though they're not stuffy, they address clients as 'sir,' and 'madam,' and remember their anniversaries. 'Is it a special occasion?' the reservationist asks when she calls to confirm each night's bookings. At Auberge, you sense, it always is.</p><p>The menu titles are written in French. The music ranges from Duke Ellington to crackly French crooners to xylophone jazz; it doesn't range much past the 1950s. The cheapest a la carte dinner entree costs $39.</p><p>But if all that sounds like a formula for restaurant suicide in this post-post-fine dining era, you should walk by at dinner some time and have a peek through the latticed windows, or make a reservation, even, if fancy French food is your thing.</p><p>Auberge du Pommier is crammed these days: not just with legions of older regulars, but also with young, doe-eyed couples from the neighborhood , business types wielding laptops in the two private dining rooms (the restaurant is surrounded by corporate offices), tables of Mainland Chinese in windbreakers, toasting - ganbei! - with Bordeaux.</p><p>What brought me there for a pair of dinners earlier this month was the resume of Auberge's executive chef, Marc St. Jacques, who took over the stoves last year. Mr. St. Jacques was born in Belgium, grew up in Montreal and Toronto, and learned to cook at the Culinary Institute of America, one of the world's most respected chef schools. After graduating, he went to work for a U.S. celebrity chef named Michael Mina, rising to lead the kitchen brigade at Mr. Mina's Michelin-starred restaurant in Las Vegas's Bellagio Hotel.</p><p>Where his cooking in Vegas was distinctly contemporary, at Auberge du Pommier, Mr. St. Jacques's work is rooted in large part in the classics. It is progressive-conservative, if you have to put a name on it: High French, but through a cautiously contemporary lens.</p><p>Chef's steak tartare gets a daub of cornichon jelly and chopped egg whites, but is otherwise a faithful (and very tasty) nod to the standard. The tournedos Rossini, part of the six-course tasting menu recently, switches out the usual toasts for buttery mashed potatoes, but doesn't otherwise stray: the beef, a cylinder of dry-aged Cumbrae's rib eye, is seared to medium rare, pooled with Madeira and truffle sauce, topped with pan-fried foie gras. It's a comestible heritage moment, a taste back through history. That dish is delicious, also, especially with the Fronsac they pair alongside.</p><p>The restaurant's 'agneau' plate brings an enormous, bone-in lamb shank that's been cured in herbs and salt, then confited in fat to melting. There's a pool of black-olive jus around it, a trio of deep-fried lamb croquettes, a touch of white anchovy, a mound of polenta, spears of grilled romaine.</p><p>For meat lovers of the old school, it's a plate of glory; you hardly notice those more forward-looking sides. (For palates more attuned to modern tastes, only a zip more of acidity to cut the melted collagen in the lamb would make it better.)</p><p>Occasionally, Mr. St. Jacques strays. His dish called 'Oeuf' is a love letter not to tradition but to superb local ingredients and modern bistronomie cooking: it's about the flavour and texture and provenance of a single, perfect, dark-yolked egg, softly poached and encased in a packet of thinly sliced Niagara ham.</p><p>It looked and tasted as if the chef had allowed himself to play a little: the oozy orange voluptuousness of the egg's yolk against the salt and porcine meatiness of the ham, the mellow, minor-key sour of pickled garlic, the sweetness of confit shallots, the smokehouse soul of its black truffle and bacon jus. (The one thing missing from the plate: something to sop it all up with.)</p><p>Yet in other cases, the more modern dishes were less convincing. In a nod, one presumes, to nearby Forest Hill, Mr. St. Jacques served house-smoked salmon slices with bagel chips and 'horseradish panna cotta,' as the menu called it. Far from tasting light and refreshing, as panna cotta should, this was as thick and heavy and mouth-coating as a bowlful of Philadelphia cream cheese. On another starter, he wrapped humdrum chilled lobster salad into strips of limp-tasting grilled zucchini and served it with yuzu-spiked aioli. 'For the money, I want a bit more za-za-zou,' my dinner date one night said.</p><p>Though he is doubtless an excellent chef, it felt at times like Mr. St. Jacques was pulling his punches, as if in coming home to Canada he had allowed himself to fall into the fold of an institution that has more far history than he. Yet looking around the busy room, I could understand it. They're busy, with diners who are happy. So what if it isn't challenging food?</p><p>For dessert, we had a lemon souffle and a good plate of chocolate, and then a pair of macarons that arrived with the bill. And it was hard just then to deny the seductiveness of it all.</p>, <p>If the Progressive Conservatives go down to defeat in Monday's general election in Alberta, it will be because a central tenet of the party's early success was ignored.</p><p>It was Peter Lougheed who built the foundation of the Tories' four-decades-old dynasty upon the principle that the path to a happy, contented party starts at the door of the government caucus. As such, he gave his backbench MLAs unprecedented authority to overrule decisions of cabinet.</p><p>'I was aware that I was a leader with members who had diverse views,' Mr. Lougheed said in an interview this week. 'And I knew it was really important for me to capture the diversity of those views in a way that they were all comfortable with the decision making.'</p><p>Mr. Lougheed would rule this way for 14 years - a tenure devoid of any significant internal tension and strife, and in marked contrast to the more tenuous mandates of recent PC leaders Ed Stelmach and Alison Redford.</p><p>Polls would indicate the Tories are heading to defeat at the hands of Wildrose, a political entity born of the disenchantment felt by those on the conservative wing of the province's long-time governing party. If it happens, political historians will be examining the entrails of the cataclysmic shift in Alberta politics for years to come.</p><p>The seeds of the Wildrose's resurgence were likely sown years ago, in the massive majorities that the Tories routinely racked up. Facing literally no opposition on the right, the only room for the party to grow was on the left. As Alberta became a more urban province, it was also a strategy that seemed compatible with an urge to appear more modern and desirable to a voter who had more cosmopolitan tastes and interests.</p><p>Conservatives in the party could live with a policy agenda that was more socially liberal but not one that was fiscally imprudent or that didn't adhere to the low tax principles that were the bedrock of business in Alberta. And so when Premier Ed Stelmach hiked oil and gas royalties there was outrage, both inside and outside his caucus. Donations started pouring in to the upstart Wildrose. When Mr. Stelmach started running deficits there was additional fury. His policies eventually led to the defection of two of his MLAs to Wildrose.</p><p>When Alison Redford took over, she introduced another deficit budget that contained wild spending promises. Like her political hero Peter Lougheed, Ms. Redford comes from the progressive wing of the party. But the PC leader's ultimate failing may be that she refused to throw her conservative base even the tiniest bit of red meat to satiate its appetite. It would, at this point anyway, appear to be a remarkable error in judgment - and one that seems unimaginable during Mr. Lougheed's reign.</p><p>'Our caucus represented such a broad cross section of the province because we had such large majorities,' Mr. Lougheed remembers. 'That's why it was so important to hear from all MLAs because they represented all those constituencies. That's why we gave them ultimate authority on issues because they really represented the people.'</p><p>A common sense doctrine that would be forgotten.</p><p>The fracturing of the centre-right coalition in Alberta has obvious similarities with one occurring next door in British Columbia to the governing Liberal party.</p><p>While both cases serve as modern-day examples of the perils of leading big-tent coalitions, they may also be a manifestation of a right-wing surge. With a majority government in Ottawa, conservative-minded voters in Canada's two most western provinces seem to have found a little swagger and are certainly less inclined to support coalitions that diminish or worse ignore their wants and needs.</p><p>And today, those conservatives in B.C. and Alberta have credible, attractive options that haven't previously existed.</p><p>'I think you can fairly make the argument that now that right wingers are having success on the federal stage, they're less willing to compromise at the provincial stage,' says Royce Koop, a public policy professor at Simon Fraser University. 'But I also think this is a story about leadership. We're not having this conversation without [Wildrose leader]Danielle Smith, and the broad appeal she has and the terrific campaign she has run. In B.C., John Cummins is a name politician who had instant credibility with conservative-minded voters.'</p><p>But for all the similarities between the fracturing coalitions in Alberta and B.C., there is one glaring difference: Those disaffected conservatives in Alberta have less to lose by voting Wildrose. If the party doesn't win power, it will be the PCs that do - and this time around they are likely do a much better job of tending to the coalition. In B.C., by supporting the Conservatives and not the Liberals, voters there could help elect a left-wing New Democratic Party government. And that is a far different option than Wildrose supporters face.</p><p>For now, however, the focus is on Alberta and the imminent threat to one of the longest political dynasties in the Western world. Peter Lougheed must consider his party's situation and think how avoidable it could all have been. But like the discreet figure he's been in retirement, he's not too talkative on that subject.</p><p>'You must have some thoughts on what has happened?' he's asked.</p><p>'Yes,' he replies. 'But not ones you're going to get.'</p>, <p>A year from now, will there still be a Liberal Party in power anywhere outside Prince Edward Island?</p><p>If a party is not in power federally or in any large province, is it still a major party? Or is it just an older, more venerable equivalent of the Greens?</p><p>These are the questions-of-existence that Liberals face across Canada. Salvation, if the party is to be saved, lies in a number: 20,000.</p><p>Before we get to that number, a quick tour. At the national level, not only are the Liberals leaderless and struggling to attract the support of even one voter in five. The ongoing gradual elimination of public subsidies threatens the party's ability to function.</p><p>In Quebec, Jean Charest's Liberals trail in the polls. If they are defeated on Sept. 4, revelations of corruption from the Charbonneau Inquiry could render the brand toxic, opening the door to the CAQ or a provincial NDP as the default federalist alternative to the Parti Quebecois.</p><p>In British Columbia, a new Conservative Party, led by John Cummins, threatens Liberal Premier Christy Clark from the right, even as Adrian Dix's NDP dominates in the polls. If the Liberals lose next year's election, the party could go the way of Social Credit, the previous conservative-in-all-but-name alternative to the NDP in B.C.</p><p>In Ontario, Liberal Premier Dalton McGuinty pulled a rabbit out of the electoral hat last year, but he now heads a minority government, challenged both by Tim Hudak's Conservatives and Andrea Horwath's NDP.</p><p>In other provinces ... actually, there are no other provinces where Liberals are in government, outside the Ghiz administration in PEI. Conservative parties of one stripe or another govern Alberta, Saskatchewan, Newfoundland and Labrador and New Brunswick. The NDP holds sway in Manitoba and Nova Scotia.</p><p>The national and provincial wings of political parties are, of course, almost completely unaffiliated. But they do share the same brand name, and that matters hugely.</p><p>Seven years ago, the Liberal brand dominated federally and in the three largest provinces. A year from now, it could be associated with power nowhere outside Green Gables. With virtually no affiliation between brand and government, how does the idea of Liberal survive?</p><p>There is a reason for this existential decline. For years, now, polls have shown that voters care about two things above all: health care and the economy.</p><p>But polls also show that voters don't believe governments can do much to improve the quality of health care. They do believe governments influence the economy: by raising or lowering taxes, balancing budgets or running deficits, helping to create jobs or helping to lose them.</p><p>Furthermore, about four voters in 10 agree with this statement: Government policies usually do more harm than good. About six in 10 believe government can help. This is what pollsters and analysts mean when they say the Canadian electorate is polarizing.</p><p>Those 4-in-10 pessimists generally vote Conservative. The other six vote Liberal, NDP, PQ, BQ or Green. Increasingly, they appear to be inclining to the NDP as an unambiguous alternative to the laissez-faire Conservatives. This is what is killing the Liberal brand. It doesn't identify strongly with either side of the debate. This could prove fatal.</p><p>If the Liberal brand is to be revived, the federal level is a good place to start. And that's where that 20,000 number comes in.</p><p>This is how many people have joined the newly created category of Liberal Party supporter. These aren't dues-paying members. They simply affirm their support for the party and its values. And they will get to vote, along with members, for the next leader. In essence, the Liberals will hold one large U.S.-style primary next April to select a new chief. Any Canadian who wants to can cast a ballot.</p><p>Depending on who runs, and how successful the candidates are at defining - or redefining - the Liberal brand, that nascent core of 20,000 supporters could grow to 200,000 or 2 million.</p><p>In that sense, who leads the Liberals after April matters less than how many people sign up as supporters. For if the party is to create a new national base, those supporters will be that base.</p><p>The future of the Liberal brand depends on what 20,000 grows to. The party will live or die by the final number. It's as simple as that.</p><p> </p>, <p>This past Wednesday, during a 'telephone town hall' with Wisconsin, after establishing that he has some connections to that state, presidential hopeful Mitt Romney elaborated.</p><p>'One of the most humorous, I think, relates to my father. You may remember my father, George Romney, was president of an automobile company called American Motors,' he said, as though the town-hall participants were tucked into bed to hear the end of the story from the night before, and as though his father were Paddington Bear.</p><p>'They had a factory in Michigan, and they had a factory in Kenosha, Wisconsin, and another one in Milwaukee, Wisconsin,' Mr. Romney said. 'And as the president of the company, he decided to close the factory in Michigan and move all the production to Wisconsin. ...'</p><p>I imagine that, on the day before the town hall, as Mr. Romney stood before his advisers rehearsing this story, one of them interrupted at this point and said something along these lines: 'Pardon me, Mr. Romney, but do you have any anecdotes about you or your family that do not involve someone doing something Dr. Evil would have done?'</p><p>'Wait, wait. Let me finish,' I guess Mr. Romney replied, breaking down into a fit of giggles, before continuing to tell the story, exactly as he would tell it the next day. 'Now, later he decided to run for governor of Michigan, and so you can imagine that having closed the factory and moved all the production to Wisconsin was a very sensitive issue to him. ...'</p><p>'Sir,' the adviser likely tried again. 'Currently there's some concern about your image. Your numbers among voters aged 35 to 66 who've long dreamed of being governed by Thurston Howell III are good. You have all seven of those votes locked up. But a CNN poll released this week puts you a full 10 points behind Obama and I'm not sure this story is ...'</p><p>'Say, how old are you?' Mr. Romney asked the speaker affably. 'Around 32? Are you Dutch?'</p><p>'Fifty-three. Lithuanian, sir. Same as at lunch.'</p><p>'I've never been to Lithuania, but a buddy of mine owns it. Says it's real fine,' Mr. Romney responded cheerfully before explaining, as he eventually did in the telephone town hall, that the school marching band touring with his father on that campaign knew how to play Wisconsin's fight song, but not Michigan's.</p><p>'Every time they would start playingOn Wisconsin! On Wisconsin!, my dad's political people would jump up and down and try to get them to stop, because,' Mr. Romney continued, laughing, just as he did later, during the town hall, 'they didn't want people in Michigan to be reminded that my dad had moved production to Wisconsin.'</p><p>'Why was a school marching band touring with your dad anyway?' another aide asked fearfully. 'I mean where were all the schoolchildren of Michigan during all this? Did the band have to march from Wisconsin? And could they only play the one song? Was this band really good enough to be on tour? I just want to cover all the angles there, before you slay the crowd with this one.'</p><p>But Mr. Romney had doubled over in laughter and was thus unavailable for comment for a while, although he eventually straightened up and, his story now told, began wandering jauntily about the room, shaking hands and patting shoulders.</p><p>'Hello, and how are you today?' he said gamely, shaking one bystander's hand. 'Is that 'bling-bling' you're wearing?'</p><p>'It's my wedding ring,' she replied with a sigh.</p><p>'Wedding ring! Excellent, excellent. And how long have you been married?'</p><p>'Forty-three wonderful years, Mitt. I'm your wife. From Michigan. Same as at breakfast.'</p><p>'I have 14 cars!' he said, nodding warmly, before moving on to the next person in the room.</p><p>'I really think we should lock in the town-hall-meeting anecdote now, Mr. Romney,' the adviser tried again. 'It's noon.'</p><p>'Same as at the Olympics!' Mr. Romney said happily.</p><p>'Uh, yes, same as at the Olympics,' replied the 53-year-old Lithuanian adviser (who had, to tell the truth, begun viewing Mitt Romney less as a 'presidential hopeful' and more as a 'presidential eternal optimist'). 'Do you have another story you could tell?'</p><p>'One time, I was swimming in my pool of money and ...' Mr. Romney began merrily.</p><p>'Something else?' the adviser said.</p><p>'We used to have a pet ...' Mr. Romney obliged, already giggling.</p><p>'No!' the aide cried out, along with the rest of the room. 'Tell the one about your dad firing all those people. That'll be fine.'</p>, <p>Between them, the group of veteran anglers have more than 200 years of experience fishing the Cowichan River - and they think that gives them the right to tell the government how the river on southern Vancouver Island should be managed.</p><p>It's hard to argue otherwise because the group, which gathered for a formative meeting on the banks of the Cowichan last week, represents an astonishing collection of wisdom.</p><p>David Anderson was there, a former federal fisheries minister. For many years he was the environmental conscience of the government led by the late Pierre Elliot Trudeau.</p><p>So was Bob Hooton, who was perhaps British Columbia's most eminent (and certainly most outspoken) steelhead biologist when he retired in 2008, after 37 years of exemplary government service.</p><p>Another member of the group was retired conservation officer, Gary Horncastle. He once tried to save an elk that was tangled in barbed wire by giving it CPR. The elk died, but the fact that Mr. Horncastle tried to revive a seven-point bull, weighing more than 350 kilograms, tells you something about his character. He's no quitter, that's for sure.</p><p>And neither is Joe Saysell, the retired fishing guide who has spent his entire life on the Cowichan, and who convened the group at his home because he felt his beloved river was in dire need of help.</p><p>'I've been watching the fish stocks on this river go down for a decade. It's time we did something about this,' he said.</p><p>Mr. Saysell, with 60 years of experience on the river, knows the Cowichan better than anyone and has spent much of his adult life fighting to protect it. His efforts are largely responsible for the green corridor that lines both banks of the upper river.</p><p>'I wanted to get a small, influential, knowledgeable group together. A group that would put fish first, and wouldn't be afraid to speak out,' he said. 'We've got to get away from that old concept of managing [the resource] for the fishermen. If we manage for the fish, in the end, both the fishermen and the fish are looked after. But if we manage for the fishermen, in the end, the fish lose.'</p><p>The group is calling itself, Friends of the Cowichan. But given their collective age and experience, perhaps River Elders might have been a better name.</p><p>Sports anglers in B.C. number more than 300,000 and they have no shortage of groups that speak out on their behalf.</p><p>But Mr. Saysell said most angler organizations are concerned primarily with providing 'more fishing opportunities,' and that means lobbying for fewer gear restrictions and longer fishing seasons.</p><p>The Friends of the Cowichan want the opposite.</p><p>'We have protected the habitat on this river with the green corridor. Now, the only way left to protect fish is through more stringent fishing regulations,' said Mr. Saysell. 'We want to make it harder, not easier, to catch fish.'</p><p>That will put him up against groups like the B.C. Wildlife Federation and the B.C. Federation of DriftFishers.</p><p>'I never thought that I'd be fighting fishermen, but then I always thought fishermen would put fish first. Sadly, things have changed,' said Mr. Saysell. 'Now a lot of fishermen only think about how many fish they can catch. The sport to them is about putting up big numbers, so they can brag to their buddies. And they don't care how or where they fish.'</p><p>Mr. Saysell said he regularly sees anglers fishing over spawning grounds, using eggs for bait, which fish can't resist. Or he sees anglers using a technique known as 'flossing,' in which a long line is drifted through a school of salmon, until it slips into the open mouth of a breathing fish. Then the angler yanks the hook home, snagging the fish on the outside of its mouth.</p><p>'There are times and places to fish. The spawning grounds isn't one of those places,' said Mr. Saysell. 'And snagging shouldn't happen anywhere, ever.'</p><p>He said his group hopes to start talking to government officials this week.</p><p>It is going to be hard to ignore the Cowichan's new voice of reason.</p>, <p>Now that Season 1 ofThe Real Housewives of Lorne Park has become an unlikely ratings sensation, Rogers Cable Television looks to spin the hit formula into a reality-TV gold.

Our nations are considering how they govern themselves (their core institutions of government) and what they govern (their jurisdictions). Central to this discussion is determining an appropriate system of land tenure that reflects a particular nation's culture and traditions while also supporting the development of an economy. This necessarily includes a conversation about what types of legal interests in land can be created, who can hold them and how they are recorded. Every nation that has gone through the process of moving beyond the Indian Act has undertaken this work - work required to translate hard-fought-for aboriginal rights into practical and real change on the ground in each of our communities.</p><p>As a result of our nations' governance-rebuilding work, there are already many different types of land-tenure systems on First Nation lands; systems that support property rights and, to use the language of economist Hernando de Soto, 'unlock the capital' of First Nation lands.</p><p>These systems have been developed carefully in order to ensure that collective interests in the land remain so our people have a place they can live and practise our respective cultures and maintain 'community.' And to ensure that the primary economic gain from the capital created in our land goes to our citizens (either collectively through our governments or to individuals as property owners) and not to third parties and potential speculators.</p><p>The land tenure discussion in our communities has, therefore, not been just about what is needed to make the land more marketable or provide security of tenure, but how to do so while maintaining a community and collective rights. When it comes to property systems, both domestically on or off reserve, and internationally, there are, of course, many ways to govern.</p><p>Recently, there has been talk of a proposed federal First Nations Property Ownership Act (FNPOA), which reflects a particular ideological approach to land ownership. The manner in which this proposed bill has been promoted suggests there is no property ownership on First Nation lands today. Also, that creating fee simple interests - where, we assume, title would be raised through a new national body and possibly held by non-Indians - is the best solution. The potential introduction of this bill, which we also understand would be optional for each nation, is creating much debate.</p><p>Debate is good. However, it is important that the debate does not take away or distract from the important work that is already well under way in our nations to reform land management, or take away from the more fundamental work of nation rebuilding. Determining a land tenure system, while important, is only one part of the solution. Each of our nations needs to go through its own process of deconstructing the colonial past, and the solutions certainly cannot be imposed or dictated by the Crown.</p><p>It is not clear at this time which of the more than 600 nations support the approach taken in the FNPOA. The Assembly of First Nations, through a chiefs' resolution, has expressed opposition to the FNPOA. However, as with any initiative, if nations want to pursue a particular option, that is their prerogative, but it cannot be imposed on others. Further, as there are limited federal resources to support moving beyond the Indian Act, it is important that resources are directed to initiatives where there is strong support and the best chance of success. For legitimate and well-thought-out policy reasons, most of our nations do not support or see the need for the FNPOA.</p><p>But don't confuse this with thinking they do not support change and moving away from the Indian Act. Rather, First Nations are advancing innovative and sustainable approaches that will unlock capital, create partnerships and protect their lands and resources for future generations consistent with their rights and responsibilities - on their own terms. And it means the approach and ideological underpinnings of the FNPOA is simply not for them.</p><p>Jody Wilson-Raybould is the Assembly of First Nations' Regional Chief of British Columbia.</p>, <p>Tuesday is Valentine's Day, but there's more than love in the air in Quebec. It will also be opening day at the National Assembly and, although Jean Charest's government has more than a year left on the clock, everyone seems to be gearing up for an early election.</p><p>The Premier's critics say he has no choice, since things are unlikely to improve, although Mr. Charest ruled out a spring vote on Thursday. His Liberals have spent the past 18 months in political limbo, amid allegations of corruption and low public confidence in the Premier.</p><p>After months of infighting that relegated the sovereignty issue to the back burner (if not the freezer), the Parti Quebecois isn't in much better shape.</p><p>And now there's the Coalition Avenir Quebec - a political medley of old and new faces drawn from right and left, federalists and sovereigntists. The party will enter its first election under the leadership of former PQ cabinet minister Francois Legault, a competent manager and a seasoned politician but hardly a charismaticrassembleur.</p><p>Although the polls suggest the CAQ enjoys considerable support, it may have peaked too soon. Mr. Legault's mantra ofon verra (we'll see) is hardly an engaging call to arms, and the new slogan,on doit faire mieux (we must do better), isn't much more inspiring. As the CAQ becomes less of an abstraction, it will face the challenge of turning a small band of refugees from the Action Democratique du Quebec's ashes and a few PQ floor-crossers into a majority government.</p><p>All three parties will be using their time in the National Assembly to set the tone. Several campaign issues are already evident, including the fundamental question of Quebec's economic future, the persistent tension between the 're-engineering' of the state and the province's social contract, and the unfinished business of cleaning up the mess in the construction industry.</p><p>Economic leadership is a crucial element for any Quebec government, but no less important is the fundamental role of speaking for Quebeckers and defending their interests in the federation. In fact, with the Bloc Quebecois almost vanished from the House of Commons and the relative absence of Quebec voices in the halls of federal power, this role will become even more important at the provincial level. Indeed, the key issue in this election may well be who can stand up for Quebec against Stephen Harper. Quebeckers may be politically hard to read these days, but their antipathy toward the Ottawa Conservatives is palpable and growing.</p><p>On this question, Mr. Legault and the CAQ have very little traction, and even less street cred. At its core, theirs is an inward-looking party, focused on economic and social policy in Quebec with a platform that explicitly refuses to mention constitutional issues and carries no mention of Ottawa or federalism. But Quebec does not exist in a bubble, and Mr. Legault's opponents are hoping to remind voters of this.</p><p>PQ Leader Pauline Marois has already sounded the alarm, calling Mr. Harper the antithesis of Quebec values: a monarchist, militarist, right-wing social conservative. Her solution: a PQ government that can fight for Quebec 'as if it were a country' against the Conservative tide.</p><p>Mr. Charest knows how to use the federalism card to his advantage. He has been relentless in opposing Mr. Harper's gun-control and pension reforms. As a leader among his peers, last month's Council of the Federation meeting showcased how he can act as best defender of Quebec's interests in terms of collaborative federalism with the other premiers.</p><p>Antonia Maioni is an associate professor of political science at McGill University.</p>, <p>A weird thing happened in Canada last week. The premiers of Quebec and Alberta got together and had a friendly conversation about oil. This could be a first. The two provinces usually are bitter rivals, especially when Quebec's premier is a sovereigntist.</p><p>But these two premiers have a lot in common. They're the new girls in the old boys' club. Both Alison Redford and Pauline Marois are smart, hard-working women who paid their dues and earned their success against long odds. Both are principled and grounded. You get the feeling you could run into either one of them at Costco.</p><p>Just coincidence? Or maybe things have really changed. A new generation of female political talent has come of age. Kathy Dunderdale is popular in Newfoundland and Labrador. Christy Clark is hanging on in B.C. (until May, at least). Eva Aariak is Premier of Nunavut. And Ontario's next premier could be a woman - two of the most able candidates in the race to succeed Dalton McGuinty are Sandra Pupatello and Kathleen Wynne. Before long, Canada's four biggest provinces could all have female premiers.</p><p>Think how the atmosphere at premiers' conferences will change with all that estrogen in the room. No more silly jock talk. Instead, leaders will be asking each other where they got those fabulous shoes.</p><p>I like Alison Redford a lot. She's authentic and direct, a classic Red Tory centrist. Her personal heroes are Peter Loughheed and Nelson Mandela (she met and travelled with him just after he got out of jail). She believes in building bridges, not firewalls. She thinks the whole country ought to benefit from Alberta's petro-wealth. She has no trouble saying global warming is for real, but she also makes the case for all the social goods that flow from oil. She's an articulate and credible champion of responsible resource development.</p><p>Our energy challenges are immense, and how we tackle them will shape our future. Is Ms. Redford tough enough for the job? Some people don't think so. They say Alberta needs an aggressive, hairy-chested fighter to get those pipelines built. Perhaps they're referring to Danielle Smith, leader of the Wildrose Party. She's a woman, too.</p><p>Ms. Marois has also found the centre of the road. She has an economy to run, and she's obviously aware that she won't get re-elected if she screws it up. You can't endorse her politics, but she has held together a fragile coalition and outlasted her rivals, both inside her party and outside. She knows she has to win the confidence of business, and has made it clear that sovereignty is on hold. That's why she showed up at the premiers' meeting in Halifax and agreed to discuss a pipeline to the east. She even told her anti-Alberta environment minister to put a sock in it.</p><p>Do women bring a different tone to politics? Often, they do. Ms. Redford can switch back and forth between the global energy revolution and the shortage of daycare in Alberta, and sound equally comfortable with both. Women are good at using their own families' stories to connect to voters. And they have a different way of demolishing their opponents. Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard recently delivered the most blistering speech on sexism I have ever heard. It was a masterly piece of political theatre that reduced her hapless victim to a grease spot on the floor. Men use sledgehammers; women use stilettos.</p><p>It's great to see strong women on the public stage who are neither showboats (Sheila Copps) nor dingbats (Kim Campbell, anyone?). The U.S. has Hillary Clinton and Nancy Pelosi, and Germany has Angela Merkel. (The euro zone would probably come unglued without her.) Their accomplishments affirm that the sordid business of politics can actually be a respectable, even noble, calling. Not that I believe female politicians are nobler or more virtuous than men. But, generally, they're less puffed up.</p><p>I've no idea whether the new girls on the scene will succeed. Politics is a chancy calling, half skill, half luck. But I want to wish them well. I love it when two women get together to discuss pipelines. It's about time.</p>, <p>The proposal by a Toronto city councillor to investigate the idea of selling two of the city's major commuter arteries and paying for their maintenance with tolls demonstrates two important points: 1) that there are some good options available for fixing the city's clogged commuter routes that don't involve tax dollars; and 2) Toronto only knows how to plan its transportation future in the most hodge-podge and ad-hoc fashion imaginable.</p><p>The idea put forward by Councillor Adam Vaughan is one that seems to be working in other major North American cities. Both New York and Boston, for instance, are ringed with expressways and tunnels that are supported by tolls. The roads aren't necessarily in the hands of private third parties; for instance, the Lincoln Tunnel between New Jersey and Manhattan is operated by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. The toll for going into Manhattan is a whopping $13 for a car, while the return trip is free.</p><p>Drivers hate tolls, of course, because they cost money, and also because the collection process slows traffic. On Toronto's Gardiner Expressway and the Don Valley Parkway, the latter concern is irrelevant at rush hour, when traffic habitually slows to a crawl anyway. And collection can be speeded up, if necessary, with the use of transponders that allow for the automated collection of tolls.</p><p>As for selling the roads, or setting up a private-public partnership, that too is worth exploring. As Mr. Vaughan suggests, such a move might free up monies that could be used to expand the city's underwhelming transit system.</p><p>The point is, Toronto's commuting infrastructure is inadequate, and becoming more so with each passing year. The population of the Greater Toronto Area continues to grow, as does the exodus to the suburbs, where homes are more affordable. The city is currently faced with the prospect of hundreds of millions of dollars in repairs to a crumbling section of the Gardiner. Council, already squeezed financially, needs to keep an open mind about every option.</p><p>Typically, though, Mr. Vaughan's suggestion has come on the eve of a budget meeting, scheduled for Monday, at which the repairs to the Gardiner will be discussed. This is how the critical issue of commuting is handled in Toronto: last-minute ideas thrown into a mix that includes an agency, Metrolinx, charged with expanding the region's mass-transit system, and a mayor, Rob Ford, with his own ideas about what needs to be done. Toronto's commuting nightmare is a problem that can't be fixed with eleventh-hour proposals. It needs a coherent and integrated set of solutions.</p>, <p>Do you have fresh ideas? No cash? No job? You can't remember life before the Internet? As you read this, you may figure out that your best job prospects are on the computer screen you now use mostly to download movies from BitTorrent while you worry about your future (that is, not having one).</p><p>What if someone told you that you can start a business or get a job simply by marketing what you know, and squeezing every dime out of your personal expenses to help devote more money to your business? Would you try? What have you got to lose?</p><p>Young people and curious seasoned types with fresh, open minds have a solid foundation on which to build a business. Your best asset is that you don't think like an old man set in his ways. Lots of older people who run businesses need your ability to see something not being done as efficiently as it could be. So, to start a business, think of a result and then backward-engineer a process to achieve it.</p><p>You have no money? I know you can start a business without any money. I'm talking about working capital to build an infrastructure. I now have money, and like other people with it, I will pay for information that I don't have. Here's how you can start:</p><p>1) Think about how to save somebody money</p><p>What do I pay for that you can teach me to do for less or for free? Here's a good example. I thought that my cellphone was too expensive and a friend told me that she could renegotiate my bill. After an hour on the phone with my cell and cable provider, I had the same service for $1,600 less per year. She did that as a favour, but I encouraged her to start a business and charge 25% of the first-year savings. If you sign up 20 new people a month and save them all that much, that's a decent business.</p><p>2) Don't waste time</p><p>I don't watch TV or surf the Net until I've exhausted all the work I need to do. Time wasted is money wasted. Keep a detailed log of what you do every hour of the day. Cut out wasted time and replace it with activities that will make you richer or smarter. Do you get up early? Do somebody's shopping for them at an all-night grocery store and charge them.</p><p>3) Trade skills</p><p>If you cut hair for a living and need a website designed, find a web designer who needs haircuts. If you can take photographs and need a laptop, find a computer store that sells used computers and needs better photos for its site. Catch my drift?</p><p>4) Use online information aggregators to identify opportunities and customers</p><p>Online word of mouth is a great thing. You can be in Nelson, B.C., Yellowknife or in your underwear in your basement in Corner Brook and start a page on a social network or place a classified ad on Kijiji to explain what you can do. Find me a place to get cheap business cards, cheap winter tires or a flight to Marrakesh for my next holiday, or do some other research for me. You can be an information slave to one person or many. And get a PayPal account so you can get paid.</p><p>I didn't come up with this idea. Users of cheap labour congregate on sites like Amazon's Mechanical Turk. Check out what people are asking others to do, and see how they are paying for it.</p><p>Or identify something they aren't doing yet but might want to do as they expand their own businesses. Barbara Edwards was an assistant in a Toronto fine art gallery who began approaching respected local artists to represent them in a new gallery that she hadn't actually opened. After she got a small space, she wrote to the estate managers of several big-name deceased U.S. artists, asking if she could represent them in Canada. After meeting her, a couple of them agreed.</p><p>I spoke to Edwards about her lack-of-cash experience at an artist opening recently. Everything in her gallery looked expensive. I asked her how far her apartment was from her work. She sheepishly pulled a heavy curtain back. There was her bed and clothes closet. She had renovated what was a rough-and-ready space by herself. The gallery kitchen doubled as her personal kitchen. Nice. The art she shows comes on consignment. She hustles. She can afford her own place now, but she still lives there.</p><p>I did it, too. Ten years ago, I had lots of ideas and knew some stuff about business. I wrote several articles online for free and then sent them to editors at this paper. They gave me a try. Now I get paid to give advice.</p><p>Write me at dsteiner@globeandmail.com and tell me your no-money-to-success story. I'll convince my editor to let me write about you. He'll pay me and you'll get free publicity. You get it now? Once you start hustling using your brain, and see the fruits of your labour, you'll never stop.</p><p>Doug Steiner has a real job in the financial services business in Toronto.</p>, <p>The Supreme Court of Canada has opened a Pandora's box for public school boards by finding that a British Columbia school district discriminated against a dyslexic child when, during a financial crisis, it closed a special-education centre that provided him intensive help in learning to read. From here on, schools, school boards or provinces could be forced to bleed other programs to meet court-ordered educational standards for special-needs students.</p><p>The court appears to have been blind to the practical effects of its ruling. How could those effects be anything but massive after the court perhaps unwittingly defined adequacy, or 'meaningful access' to education, in a way that few if any school boards meet? 'Realistically, we don't have the supports we need in every single school,' a Toronto principal said after the ruling, mentioning a lack of psychologists, social workers and special-needs assistants.</p><p>The court would have a case if Jeffrey Moore's special needs had been ignored, but they emphatically were not; he received half-hour, one-on-one sessions three times a week with a learning assistance teacher, and two 40-minute sessions with a volunteer tutor, in Grade 1. A psychologist later recommended he receive more intensive help at a special centre run by the North Vancouver school district. But then the district closed the centre. The Supreme Court, noting that the district kept an outdoor education program open in spite of its financial difficulties, found that it had illegally discriminated. Is it the court's business to choose a school district's programs, or prescribe the required intensity of extra help?</p><p>The court's definition of adequacy is stunningly open-ended. A psychologist had said the centre's intensive help would be beneficial; to the court, that meant it was required. By that standard, anyone with a child who is autistic, developmentally delayed, suffering from anxiety or depression or a myriad of other diagnosed difficulties, would have a claim on their public school for intensive services. Would a child too anxious to attend school benefit from (and therefore need) daily home visits from a tutor? How many children with behavioural problems would benefit from or need a full-time personal aide?</p><p>It makes the court's unanimous ruling more out of touch that the boy's public education unfolded between 1991 and 1994, during and after a recession marked by across-the-board restraint, and finally, the overcoming of Canada's deficit. Many political choices went into those years, and similar choices await today; governments, accountable to voters, should be the ones making those choices. The court overstepped its authority.</p>, <p>The golden era of international adoptions has come to a close. And that is a shame for the hundreds of millions of children in orphanages around the world.</p><p>Bureaucracy, escalating costs and more stringent regulations have caused a number of Canadian adoption agencies to close, and made it much harder for parents to adopt overseas.</p><p>Nepal, Guatemala, Cambodia and Liberia are on Canada's adoption blacklist, and in most provinces, so is Haiti. Popular source countries such as China and Ethiopia have reduced the number of children sent abroad for adoption.</p><p>The international adoption industry has been fraught with concerns about child trafficking and corruption. Because Canada is a signatory to the Hague Convention on the Protection of Children, the provinces must take these concerns seriously, and ensure Canadians are not inadvertently taking part in the abduction or sale of children.</p><p>However, instead of shutting down a country's entire international adoption program, wouldn't it be better to investigate specific allegations of abuse, enforce existing laws and penalize those who violate them? Canadian adoption agencies could continue to work with their overseas counterparts that follow regulations, and do not commit adoption fraud. This would allow the thousands of orphans in Guatemala, Haiti, Nepal and Ethiopia to be adopted out, in the event that they cannot be placed in homes in their own countries.</p><p>'Even if adoption law violations occur, the harm they cause children and birth parents is minimal compared to the harm caused by shutting down or severely restricting international adoptions,' says Elizabeth Bartholet, a law professor and director of the child advocacy program at Harvard Law School. 'Institutions, even the better ones, are almost always terrible for children... seriously harming their life prospects in the long term.'</p><p>In the last seven years, the number of international adoptions in Canada decreased to 1,968 from 2,180. In the U.S., it fell to 9,320 from a high of 22,991.</p><p>As countries such as China develop, there is also a growing perception by leaders there that international adoptions are something of a colonialist embarrassment. Of course, in a perfect world, Chinese orphans would be placed with families in China. But failing that, the best interests of the child should trump concerns about removing a child from her or his community. Growing up in a stable home with a family is better than being raised in an institution, even if that institution is located in your country of birth.</p>, <p>This week Premier Christy Clark appointed a cadre of communications people to her office. Just filling vacancies, the now well-staffed shop explained. Amid a government hiring freeze, however, it sends a discordant message about her government's priorities.</p><p>And the Premier's office is not the only government department that doesn't seem to have read Finance Minister Mike de Jong's latest restraint memo.</p><p>Under the rules set down three months ago by Mr. de Jong, hiring will only be approved for areas of critical service or to meet an urgent government priority. Roughly 1,000 people have been hired in that time, mostly front-line personnel such as social workers and probation officers.</p><p>Mr. de Jong, who seems to be having trouble saying 'no' to his cabinet colleagues, repeated his pledge of fiscal discipline last week during his fiscal update presentation. The deficit forecast has swelled to $1.5-billion this year, and he needs to conjure up $300-million in savings or new revenue in the coming months to meet his target of a balanced budget for the next fiscal year.</p><p>'There is virtually no room for any kind of big-time pre-election spending extravaganza,' he advised reporters last week.</p><p>Jobs Minister Pat Bell didn't get the memo. His shop is spending $11-million this year telling people, again, that his government has a jobs strategy.</p><p>Ben Stewart, Minister of Citizens Services, is looking to spend $1.5-million on Family Day celebrations just a few weeks ahead of the next provincial election.</p><p>Health Minister Margaret MacDiarmid launched a colorectal cancer screening program last month without a price tag. Why wait for treasury board approval when you have good news to announce? It wouldn't have been hard to cost it out, as the B.C. Cancer Agency had provided a detailed analysis of what the program will look like.</p><p>The biggest pre-election spending extravaganza was rolled out by the Premier in September - more than $700-million in capital spending commitments announced at an influential gathering of municipal leaders. The Finance Ministry says it has actually reined in capital spending this year, but here's the trick: Most of Ms. Clark's promises wouldn't be paid for until some time after the next provincial election.</p><p>While Mr. de Jong has managed to uncover about $80-million savings since he announced a belt-tightening exercise three months ago, the gap between his government's spending and income continues to widen. He is counting on economic growth to help him table a balanced budget next February, but that alone won't do the job. Critical resource revenues are dropping, and he needs to slow spending accordingly.</p><p>And this week, B.C. Auditor-General John Doyle argued the gap is actually much wider than Mr. de Jong is letting on. He calculates that under the rules of GAPP - generally accepted accounting principles - the province is actual more than $2-billion in deficit this year. That puts the credibility of Mr. de Jong's economic plan in doubt.</p><p>'I understand the healthy doses of skepticism that occur,' Mr. de Jong told reporters last week. 'But there is a track record of discipline here ... that says we actually respect the fact and are committed to the principle of not spending more of your money than we receive.'</p><p>Jordan Bateman, the B.C. director of the Canadian Taxpayers Federation, would love to believe that, but he is skeptical. His organization has a standing call for the B.C. government to balance the budget. It's a target that the BC Liberals have missed every year in this current term of office.</p><p>'Their restraint message is so far disconnected from their actions, I picture myself in next year's budget lockup and they come up with a balanced budget, what the heck am I supposed to say? This is the question that eroding credibility brings up: Can we believe them?'</p><p>The Liberals plan to run on economic credibility in the next election. Which explains, perhaps, the urgent and critical need for more spin doctors in the Premier's office.</p>, <p>Fast-food companies that serve burgers, fries and pizza are foisting great gobs of salt on Canadians and, it turns out, much smaller gobs on consumers in other countries. A few conclusions are inescapable: Multinationals are exposing Canadians to cardiovascular health risks that they are not exposing others to. Salt in food can be reduced somewhat, without turning off consumers. Regulatory environments and public pressure matter.</p><p>Canadians surely realize that McDonald's, Burger King, Kentucky Fried Chicken, Domino's Pizza, Subway and Pizza Hut do not, by and large, serve health food. But they are probably not aware that these establishments are regularly imposing greater amounts of salt on them than on patrons in Australia, New Zealand, the United States, France and the United Kingdom, as a study published in the Canadian Medical Association Journal shows.</p><p>The Canadian government's handling of salt has been a disappointment. Prime Minister Stephen Harper listed the setting of a national salt-reduction goal as one of his major accomplishments of 2010. But no plan to achieve that goal has gotten traction within Health Canada. Even voluntary rules involving the setting of maximums by category, or weighted to reflect the average of all products sold within a category, are seen as too onerous for industry.</p><p>The United Kingdom has achieved, over time, 40-per-cent reductions in sodium levels in some packaged foods, by creating voluntary maximums by food category. In the United States, the National Salt Reduction Initiative, a coalition of local and state governments and health groups, works with the food industry to reduce salt in packaged and restaurant foods. 'In the right regulatory environment,' the CMAJ study says, 'fast food companies could substantially reduce the salt in their products, translating to large gains for population health.'</p><p>Canadian consumers love their salty foods. It's unrealistic to expect individual companies to change on their own, while the competition goes blithely along. Government should be trying to prod industry-wide, gradual change because without government, that change won't happen.</p>, <p>Throughout the long salad days of the Liberal Party of Canada, it stood for many important things. It still stands for these things, but they're either less important now or have been adopted by other parties, leaving the Liberals as only one voice among many.</p><p>From the time of Clifford Sifton in Wilfrid Laurier's government, Liberals were the immigrants' party. They backed a more open immigration policy than the Conservatives, who tended to be the party of white Protestants with a few Irish Catholics. Now there's an all-party consensus on immigration, and the Conservatives, having starting driving up immigration levels under Brian Mulroney, fight for immigrant votes even more forcefully than Liberals.</p><p>Liberals were the bridging party between Quebec and the rest of Canada, and between francophones and anglophones. Quebec has now faded from the consciousness of other Canadians, and vice versa. The relationship is so distant as to have become more mutually tolerable, so there's neither a crisis nor much interest in bridges, which means not much interest in a party that usually stood for a strong central government.</p><p>The Liberals were the classic middle-class party, although they had plenty of wealthy supporters and used to win more trade union votes than the NDP. The middle class, however, has been under tremendous financial squeeze. Its numbers are shrinking as income inequalities widen. The pressures on middle-class families make them want to keep more of what they earn, precisely the pitch Conservatives have successfully made to them.</p><p>Liberals were always the party of Canadian nationalism, but Conservatives are busy creating their own identification with historic, national symbols: the military, the monarchy, old wars and former Conservative prime ministers. And Canadian nationalism, which seemed to need nurturing for so long, has become ubiquitous, boisterous and self-confident, the property of no party any more.</p><p>All these, and other, trends have been eating at the Liberal Party for a long time. Think of the chunks that have fallen away from the once-formidable Liberal coalition: francophones outside Quebec, many multicultural Canadians, blue-collar workers in the industrial cities of Ontario, federalist francophones in Quebec, Jews, Atlantic Canadians in cities such as St. John's, Halifax, Moncton and Saint John, the 'business' Liberals from Toronto. It was an impressive coalition, malleable when necessary, mobilized around the broad ideas for which Liberals stood.</p><p>It's early days since the shellacking of the last election for the remains of the party to gather in convention, as will happen this weekend in Ottawa. Everything remains temporary about the Liberals: its 'interim' leader, Bob Rae; its sense of policy direction; its building up (if possible) of a better fundraising machine; its national executive.</p><p>It's easy to be critical of this state of suspended uncertainty, but what else would one reasonably expect from a party trying to pick itself up from the mat? The country is four years from an election, and all speculation about the political future is futile.</p><p>A pessimist would say that the country has passed the Liberals by; that the West is ascendant and the Liberals have not spoken to that region for several generations; that Quebec no longer cares; that the lower middle class is largely lost; that the Liberals have become, as the British Liberals once were, a collection of intellectuals and individualists who get elected here and there and raise intriguing ideas but have neither the cohesion nor rootedness in any one place to contend for power.</p><p>And all this might be true, save for the possibilities of hope to which Liberals might cling - that the NDP leadership candidates are deeply traditionalist in their thinking, with none offering a broadening of the party's appeal; that the Harper government, despite its huge advantages, can't break above 40 per cent in the polls and seems determined to govern in the most polarizing ways possible; that Canada remains a fundamentally pragmatic, non-ideological kind of political entity; that the Liberals have served up two less-than-inspiring leaders in succession and can't do worse the next time; and that, at the next election, the Conservatives will have been in office for roughly 10 years, when the democratic instincts for change can imperil any party's grip on power.</p>, <p>Peter Gaskill is convinced that it makes sense to build a six-storey complex for seniors keen to live near the heart of the Dunbar business strip.</p><p>The president of Pacific Arbour Retirement Communities wants to be seen as a local hero who is striving to provide rental housing for an aging population. Instead, Mr. Gaskill's vision to construct a 130-suite building on Dunbar Street has upset residents such as Lynn Miller, who objects to a structure that would encroach on single-family zoning.</p><p>Being cast as the villain by Ms. Miller and others isn't deterring Mr. Gaskill from drafting preliminary plans. He sees his mission as a vital one for seniors requiring accommodation in their familiar, leafy neighbourhood on Vancouver's westside. They would be close to their Dunbar Village dentist, pharmacy and bank. The monthly rent will be roughly $5,000 for a one-bedroom unit in the proposed 'independent living' retirement residence. The goal is to provide seniors with three meals a day, weekly housekeeping, social outings, exercise classes and other services.</p><p>'These are pretty wealthy seniors in Dunbar, compared with the provincial average. Affordability really is a perspective thing,' said Mr. Gaskill, who warns about a looming housing crunch for people seeking spots in retirement homes, especially those age 75 years and older. He argues that if a senior is able to bank $1.5-million from a house sale and invest that money while saving on home-upkeep expenses, then $5,000 a month in rent is well within budget.</p><p>Care Planning Partners Inc., commissioned by Pacific Arbour to study the Dunbar area's demographics, noted that 3,100 people, or 12.5 per cent of the population in Dunbar and surrounding blocks, were aged 65 or over in 1996. In 2016, the number of seniors is forecast to be 4,550, or 18.3 per cent of the total. Mr. Gaskill hopes to tap into that greying market as baby boomers age.</p><p>Pacific Arbour already runs two retirement complexes in North Vancouver and one in Burnaby, and a fourth facility will open next year in West Vancouver. Mr. Gaskill now has Vancouver in his crosshairs, part of an expansion strategy to add four more retirement homes.</p><p>Privately owned Pacific Arbour recently acquired two houses on the east side of Dunbar Street, just south of West 30th Avenue. It has entered contracts to buy another four, subject to rezoning of the 4600 block of Dunbar Street. Assembling the six properties could cost a total of $20-million, with the final four houses possibly averaging $3.8-million each, or more than double their market value in single-family zoning.</p><p>'We love Dunbar, but if we're blocked from doing it because we're not allowed to build the density that we require, we will have to go somewhere else,' said Mr. Gaskill, who argues that his project fits into the 'special needs' category permitted under a city-approved, Dunbar 'community vision' document produced in 1998.</p><p>The City of Vancouver recently unveiled an interim policy to allow six storeys under certain conditions, notably to create rental or affordable housing. But Mike Andruff, a member of the Dunbar Re-vision group of neighbours, said even if Pacific Arbour obtained rezoning, the project would be two storeys too high because it is not truly affordable housing.</p><p>The popular Stong's supermarket, located just north of Pacific Arbour's planned construction site, has commercial zoning that could make it easier for its own redevelopment plans. The Harwood Group owns the property where Stong's and McDermott's auto body shop next door are situated, said Gregory Henriquez, managing partner at Henriquez Partners Architects. The firm has been retained by the Harwood Group.</p><p>Stong's, whose roots in Dunbar date back to 1931, has garnered goodwill, and the grocer is being encouraged to be the main tenant on the redeveloped site, which is zoned appropriately for four storeys, say Dunbar Re-vision members. By contrast, they say that Pacific Arbour is offside.</p><p>Mr. Gaskill has considered buying the venerable Dunbar movie theatre across the street from Stong's, but acquiring adjacent buildings will be difficult, not to mention what to do with the public library on the corner. His best bet is win approval to rezone six homes from single-family to site-specific. 'If we don't get going soon, it's going to be too late and seniors won't have their voices heard,' he said.</p>, <p>The United States may have just elected a president who talks loudly against free trade, but last weekend the U.S. Congress quietly approved a bill that is very much pro-free trade between the U.S. and Canada - making the world's busiest border a little bit thinner.</p><p>It should soon be easier for people and goods to move between Canada and the U.S. than at any time since the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.</p><p>This is a big deal for Canadians, who must contend with perennially congested crossings; that the House of Representatives and Senate thought enough of the bill to pass it before the Christmas recess speaks of the importance they accord to improving trade with Canada, which amounts to $65-billion or so per month.</p><p>Read more: U.S. Congress passes bill to enact long-awaited reforms for Canada-U.S. border</p><p>This is no small thing in an era of tough U.S. talk toward Mexico, American paranoia about threats outside its borders and a political climate where free trade has become an epithet.</p><p>The U.S. bill approves the expansion of the so-called 'preclearance' regime - an advance-screening system which has been in place in some Canadian airports since the 1950s - to other forms of transport. The expectation is that there could eventually be preclearance programs for rail, bus and car travel across the country.</p><p>Perhaps the biggest surprise is that barely eight months after Prime Minister Justin Trudeau met with President Barack Obama to discuss the proposal, a law has been sent to the Oval Office for the latter's signature. Given the dysfunctional Congressional politics of the past eight years, that represents something very close to a towering achievement.</p><p>Mr. Trudeau will justly claim part of the credit for the swift passage, but a share also goes to Prime Minister Stephen Harper, who negotiated the basis for the deal in 2011.</p><p>It was assumed as recently as the summer that the main impediment to streamlining the border process would be U.S. approval. Not so. It is now the Americans who must wait for Mr. Trudeau's government, which tabled a companion bill this summer that has not yet progressed beyond first reading. Parliament should start moving it forward immediately.</p>, <p>Realpolitik is liberating Syria from the Assad autocracy, while the institution-based international system - most notably the United Nations - has largely failed, because it depends on agreement among the permanent members of the Security Council.</p><p>Moscow seems implacably committed to supporting the Damascus regime. Such is the Russians' commitment to their traditional activist role that they are underwriting their Syrian ally at great cost to their own reputation as a constructive institution-based player, rendering impotent the mechanisms so ably used in Libya.</p><p>Even if the Russians were acting otherwise, it remains dubious how effective UN and North Atlantic Treaty Organization intervention could be. A no-fly zone would have limited impact, since Syria possesses an impressive array of military hardware. A severe sanctions regime, even banks running out of money, might have less impact than thought. Sanctions would be ignored by Russia, China, Iran and others. NATO boots on the ground would be a disaster, embedding outside players in a complex world where denominational identity trumps international standards of right and wrong. Indeed, the regime continues to draw on significant public support, despite falling morale over the setbacks of recent days.</p><p>For better or worse, we are now witnessing something much different from institution-based multilateral foreign policy. We are facing the world of realpolitik, where different, and committed actors, inside and outside Syria, are playing by standards that liberal internationalists abhor. For the most part, state players such as Canada (which has no seat on the Security Council, in any event) are contenting themselves with largely useless platitudes, even if strongly felt. Tighter teams are playing hardball, pursuing their own distinctly sovereign interests through clandestine diplomacy.</p><p>The hardball players that really count are relying on traditional raw power mechanisms. The Russians not only seek to preserve their sole naval base outside the former Soviet Union (in Tartus, on Syria's Mediterranean coast) but to protect Iran's interests in ensuring a Shia crescent stretching from Tehran to Baghdad to Damascus and ultimately to Lebanon through Hezbollah, thereby giving Moscow a key zone of influence. The ruling Alawites in Damascus represent an offshoot of Shiism that has traditionally feared and been abused by the majority Sunnis. It is to such minority Syrian communities, who value secularism, that Moscow has committed itself.</p><p>Washington is acting covertly with hard-core regional allies like Saudi Arabia and Qatar to support the Free Syrian Army on the ground. U.S. action is directed not only against autocracy and arbitrary rule. (How could it be with Saudi and Qatari bedfellows?) Rather, the shared concern of this trio is countering Shia Iranian dominance, and such co-operation is persuasive, given Iran's revanchist agenda.</p><p>This support has come in the form of Saudi and Qatari money and arms to the rebels, facilitated by Turkey and Jordan. The Central Intelligence Agency is almost certainly playing an active role in training and organizing the rebels, both in Turkey and very possibly in Syria itself, where sizable chunks of turf are controlled by insurgents. Over the past two months, the effects of that commitment on the ground have made themselves manifestly evident, elbowing out diplomatic debates in New York.</p><p>The cumulative effect of such traditional intervention is now evident. While the Syrian military has been and remains formidable, the rebellion has been too widespread for the army to concentrate sufficient force in any single place. Events of the past week have been particularly dramatic, events suggesting that we are entering a fin de regime period. Parts of Damascus, the heart of Syria, have been evacuated and central neighbourhoods are now contested; the regime's leadership is being gutted by defection and assassination; the rebels have taken control of key border crossings with Iraq and Turkey; rumours abound about President Bashar al-Assad's movements. A regime that was thought to be largely impregnable just six months ago now seems to be tottering hopelessly. Rats are increasingly abandoning the ship, a sure sign of panic.</p><p>Once the regime goes, the situation could become still more difficult. The UN will then have a role through the discovery and disposition of chemical weapons, disarmament, humanitarian aid for refugees, reconstruction, development, support for a pluralist political system and ensuring the former leadership cadres meet justice in The Hague. In these circumstances, the Russians, like it or not, may have little choice but to reconfigure their relations with the winning side.</p><p>Reform and reconstruction, however, are not going to be easy matters. Syria is a badly fractured entity, haunted by a multiplicity of identities and cultures: Sunni, Alawite, Christian, Druze, Kurdish, many of whom will consider they have lost with the demise of Baathist secularism. The Sunnis will be empowered and the minorities will see themselves at risk, fearful of what radical Islam portends.</p><p>Although it is now largely impotent, the international community should be developing plans for a wobbly and highly uncertain era.</p><p>Michael Bell, a former Canadian ambassador to Egypt, Jordan, Israel and the Palestinian territories, is Paul Martin Sr. Scholar in International Diplomacy at the University of Windsor.</p>, <p>He came to me in a dream. An awesome dream ...</p><p>'Geoff Meggs, what are you doing here?' I asked.</p><p>'I'm here to show you the future. Welcome to 2040,' he said with a smile, gesturing to the street in front of us. It was lined on both sides with impossibly tall towers. Fruit trees shaded the boulevard, their branches sagging under the weight of ripe, red apples and golden pears. In the two centre lanes, sleek light-rail trains bearing the City of Vancouver logo glided silently past. Each car was marked with a name: Spirit of George Puil, Spirit of Tim Louis. The speed of the train made it hard to make out every name - Price, Deal, Rennie - then just a blur. Bicycles occupied the rest of the roadway, piloted by happy, healthy, law-abiding riders who signalled, wore helmets, stopped for red lights, and waved courteously to each other. Children giggled, dogs frolicked, the air smelled like honey.</p><p>'Where are we?' I asked, trying to take it all in.</p><p>'This is West Broadway,' the councillor said. 'Look up the hill there. See between that 80-storey tower and that 65-storey tower, the black one?'</p><p>I squinted and made out a sliver of granite between the two buildings. 'Yeah, I see it.'</p><p>'That's City Hall,' Mr. Meggs said, 'my office.'</p><p>'You're still a city councillor?' I asked incredulously.</p><p>Councillor Meggs explained that after seeking the nomination for the NDP in 2012, he tried again in 2017, 2022, and then one last time in 2027.</p><p>'No shame in that,' he said, reaching into his pocket and pulling out a small square package. He flipped it open and pulled out what looked like a cigarette. 'Want one?' he offered.</p><p>'People still smoke in the future?' I asked.</p><p>'No, no, not tobacco. That's all in the hands of criminal gangs now,' he said with a chuckle. 'This is weed.' He held up the package so I could see the brand. 'Saturna Sativa,' he said, as he tucked it away and lit the joint. 'Not the total body stone you might expect, but it keeps my appetite up and it gets me through the meetings. Pat Carney swears by this stuff.'</p><p>'Pat Carney's still alive?'</p><p>Mr. Meggs explained marijuana turned out to have beneficial properties no one had suspected.</p><p>'So all of this is in just 28 years?'</p><p>'You were there, man. Back in 2012 - the Transportation 2040 report. You interviewed me about it, remember? We said that by 2040, two-thirds of all trips would be by bike or walking.'</p><p>'But that was just crazy talk.'</p><p>'No, man, we did it all. You see a private car anywhere around you?'</p><p>'Well, no,' I admitted.</p><p>'That's because they can't afford to drive here any more. We got it all - the vehicle charge, the regional carbon tax, the gas tax, road pricing, residential parking restrictions with huge fees. No one in their right mind would try to take a car into the city now.'</p><p>'But you said this wouldn't be a war on the car,' I reminded him.</p><p>'Yeah, well, depends on how you define 'war,' or 'car,' or 'on,' ' he shrugged, taking a last toke and holding it in.</p><p>'Who paid for all the transit?' I inquired as another gleaming, streamlined train swept by (Spirit of Sullivan, Rankin, Mel Lehan ...). 'Translink was broke.'</p><p>'Not just broke,' Councillor Meggs said, 'but disbanded after Premier Falcon declared it dysfunctional again and replaced the appointed board with some soft, padded furniture and a nice rug. We had to find another way.'</p><p>He turned and again swept an upturned palm across the scene in front of him, as though it were a prize package on a game show. 'The train? The bike paths? That was mostly car taxes, until the drivers got wise and stopped driving. Then, density-for-cash deals from developers, and finally, weed money.</p><p>'Plus, we created super-density when we allowed basement suites in lane-way houses, and approved 'shed homes.'</p><p>'With most of the cars gone, we converted underground parking lots into affordable housing and farmland. Kind of like homesteading.'</p><p>'But what do people do all day?' I asked.</p><p>'Not really sure,' he shrugged. 'Hang out? Drink coffee, smoke weed - pretty much the same things they did 28 years ago.'</p><p>'I mean for jobs,' I clarified.</p><p>'I don't have a clue,' he said, pulling a small cardboard box out of his pocket. The brightly coloured box was the same size and shape as the previous package, but this one said 'Hornby FaceMelt' across the front.</p><p>'We don't really stress about that too much.'</p><p>Stephen Quinn is the host of On the Coast on CBC Radio One in Vancouver, 88.1 FM and 690 AM. @cbcstephenquinn</p>, <p>Now Canada, too, has had its senior moment. When Prime Minister Stephen Harper suggested that Canada would soon join most other Western countries in raising its pension age to 67, he triggered an angry round of debate. We were late entering this argument: Europeans have been having it for a decade.</p><p>And it is only the beginning, because pensions represent only a tiny part of a much larger global problem. At its core are a set of non-problems: People around the world are living longer and having far fewer children - a consequence of increased female education rates and declining absolute poverty. Countries such as Bangladesh, Indonesia and Iran are now having so few children that their populations are on the verge of shrinking - as would Canada's if we didn't take immigrants.</p><p>But the consequence of smaller families is fewer young people. And family sizes have plummeted so fast, around the world, that working-age adults are being outnumbered by seniors and children, who tend to be dependent on state funds for their health, education and livelihoods.</p><p>The world is on the threshold of what might be called 'peak people.' The world's supply of working-age people will soon be shrinking, causing a shift from surplus to scarcity. As with 'peak oil' theories - which hold that declining petroleum supplies will trigger global economic instability - the claims of the doomsayers are too hyperbolic and hysterical. These are not existential threats but rather policy challenges. That said, they're very big policy challenges.</p><p>Canada's crisis is mild compared to most countries, but it's still serious. There are currently almost five working-age Canadians whose income taxes pay the pension and health-care costs of each retiree; within 20 years, there will be only three. As a result, according to Ottawa, health-care costs will double and social-service costs will rise by a third. Compared to, say, Japan, where pensioners will become a majority this century, that's nothing.</p><p>But population aging will affect us in far more profound ways, because it is global.</p><p>About 11 per cent of the world's people are over 60 at the moment. In the next 25 years that will double, to almost a fifth, and one in six of those people will be over 80, according to a forthcoming book,Global Aging in the 21st Century, by sociologists Susan McDaniel of the University of Lethbridge and Zachary Zimmer of the University of California.</p><p>While this is affecting every country and region - even sub-Saharan Africa is now seeing a very fast rise in its proportion of seniors - some countries are being hit very hard. While 12 per cent of Chinese are now over 60, in two decades, there will be more than 28 per cent. Brazil faces a similar blow. It will be very difficult for countries that are only just emerging from poverty to suddenly face huge elder-care costs.</p><p>Peak people will be an age when jobs compete for workers rather than vice versa. The cheapest labour will vanish. We're already seeing this: Because China is aging very fast, its dwindling working-age population is turning down the lowest-paid jobs and pushing up the minimum wage sharply, as well as the once-minimal costs of social services: Stuff from China will stop being cheap, because the Chinese aren't young.</p><p>This can have larger consequences than we imagine. For example, the United States appeared to be escaping the worst of the aging trend because it has an unusually high fertility rate (averaging almost 2.1 children per family, half a child more than Canada and Europe). Most analysts assumed that this was the result of American religion or prosperity. But an important new study by economists Moshe Hazan and Hosny Zoabi has found that the real reason for larger families is the unusually large supply of low-cost babysitters and child-care workers in the U.S. - mainly due to immigration, much of it 'illegal,' from Latin America. But those Central American countries and Mexico are themselves aging fast, which will soon choke off that cheap labour supply and drive up the cost of having extra kids - which will cause the U.S. to become less fertile and more elderly.</p><p>Peak people will also be an age when countries will be competing for immigrants rather than trying to limit them. Immigration has spared Canada from the worst of aging, but immigrants adopt host-country family sizes very quickly, so they're a temporary fix. And if their home countries are competing to keep them, then we'll have a harder time finding young people who want to come. It will require nimble and clever policies to prevent us from becoming old and lonely.</p>, <p>Emeril Live taught me to cook. During university, I was a devoted fan of the program that transformed the burly New Orleans chef Emeril Lagasse into a global superstar and begat the celebrity-chef craze of the past decade. Each night, as Emeril bammed(!) his way through Southern recipes, imploring viewers to 'kick it up a notch,' I was learning how to hold a knife, season fish, heat a pan, sear a steak and mince garlic. By the end of my second year, while my friends were still figuring out stir-fry, I was serving them turkey gumbo and crab cakes.</p><p>A few years ago, I finally ate at one of the chef's restaurants, in Miami Beach. Greeted by a giant portrait of Lagasse's face, I was escorted past the wrought-iron gate embossed with his florid signature onto a vast seaside terrace. The food was supposed to be the summation of Lagasse's career: the greatest hits of his nouveau Creole cooking, but it was underwhelming and overpriced. Picking around gummy scallops and a tough pork chop, I could see the restaurant for what it was ... a blatant bank withdrawal on Emeril's fame. I didn't pick up a commemorative cooking apron on the way out.</p><p>That meal came to my mind last week after reading Pete Wells's scorched-earth review of Guy's American Kitchen & Bar, in The New York Times. The Guy in question is Guy Fieri, Food Network's current catchphrase-slinging poster boy, whose Times Square flagship was designed as a destination for fans of his show Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives. Wells gutted the place with a barrage of zingers: 'Hey, did you try that blue drink, the one that glows like nuclear waste? The watermelon margarita? Any idea why it tastes like some combination of radiator fluid and formaldehyde?' It is already one of the most-read restaurant reviews of all time.</p><p>For Fieri haters, who see him as the culinary Antichrist, responsible for every aspect of bad taste - from clothing to language, from health to flavour - Wells's evisceration was sweet vindication. To Fieri's fans, it was elitist sniping at a man who celebrates the very unpretentious, blue-collar food that makes American dining great. Either way, it was inevitable this would happen. Every chef who moves from the kitchen to the limelight lives in the crosshairs, and Fieri, the most bombastic, polarizing food-television personality ever to grace the screen, knowingly waltzed into the kill zone when he opened up in Times Square.</p><p>Let's give Fieri his due. Beyond his frosted highlights, the Christian Audigier of chili dogs has done remarkable things for American popular food. Fieri shines the spotlight on earnest family businesses, many of which are struggling to survive. His fans will take road trips thousands of miles to sample the taco salads and giant burgers he showcases, raising the fortunes of those restaurants overnight.</p><p>There's a threshold a chef crosses when become he or she becomes a celebrity. In their transition from slicing shallots to signing autographs, they need to make a choice. Will they remain a kitchen chef first and foremost, like David Chang, Thomas Keller and Martin Picard, or will they be entertainers, who leave their restaurants behind like Rachel Ray or Paula Deen, bringing joy to the masses? Julia Child could have opened a whole chain of cafes, but she didn't. Not everyone has such will power.</p><p>Fieri is, above all, a host and entertainer, and he is one of the best in the business. His culinary talents (or lack thereof) are, essentially, irrelevant. Fieri spent his career in California's suburban bar-restaurants, and he still owns places like Tex Wasabi's (finally, sushi and barbecue under one roof!), but he's never been lauded as a great kitchen talent.</p><p>The same goes for Anthony Bourdain, who vocally despises Fieri and all he stands for. Bourdain wondered recently to an audience whether age would force Fieri to 'de-douche' (become less obnoxious). I remember a lacklustre meal I had at the Washington, D.C., location of Brasserie Les Halles when Bourdain was still its executive chef. In no way did the sinewy steak frites and weak service that day diminish my admiration of Bourdain's razor-sharp writing and wry observations. He'd moved beyond the need to prove himself in the kitchen, and we, as a food culture, are richer for it.</p>, <p>First things first: I'm largely agnostic on the intrinsic merits of the new initiative by the Conservative government to establish an Office of Religious Freedom within the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade. I say this because excessive argument about what's effectively a microstructure in a sizable federal department perpetuates a long-standing weakness in Canada's foreign policy debates: an intellectual obsession with 'ends' (in this case, protecting religious minorities around the world) at the expense of building the strategic 'means' to achieve any 'ends' of consequence.</p><p>Successive governments in Ottawa have all too easily subscribed to the conventional wisdom that if we as a country could only determine what our interests were, what our principles or values were, and indeed what our core international purpose was, then we could, by logic, proceed to advance a coherent and effective foreign policy agenda. All of these, of course, are concerns solely about the 'ends' of our foreign policy.</p><p>Naturally, as Canada is a vast and diverse land, and as different prime ministers have different conceptions of what the country ought to do in the world, the country almost never reaches a point of general 'consensus' about which 'ends' are worth pursuing. And so the debate continues ad nauseam, with perhaps only isolationists totally sated by the conceptual impasse that has led us to underperform as a country on the global stage.</p><p>The core of the foreign policy and larger international affairs debate in Canada should not be about the ends we may wish to pursue as a collective, but rather about the means necessary to advance the ends legitimately chosen by any elected government. The desired ends will clearly change according to the times and government, but the means to success for Canada are stable and undifferentiated, and they need to be built up.</p><p>Without this reversal of strategic logic (means before ends, rather than ends dictating means), we Canadians are left talking to ourselves about problems in the world we're interested in but typically incapable of solving - for lack of the requisite means to do so.</p><p>One is reminded of the 2007 speech by Prime Minister Stephen Harper about Canada's intending to become a leader in the Americas (a perfectly legitimate 'end' goal for a wealthy, reputable country such as Canada). Some years from now, historians in Latin America may wonder just how Canada planned to achieve its stated end of regional leadership. Answer: With no Spanish speakers! Or Portuguese speakers, for that matter. (By the time Australia had determined it wished to be a player in Asia, future prime minister Kevin Rudd - then chief of staff to the premier of Queensland - had already convinced the federal and state governments that the country needed a national Asian languages strategy.)</p><p>So what's the nature of the 'means' debate that Canada needs to have to be a major (and credible) global player this century? Two interrelated 'means' levers need to be addressed: national culture and national capabilities. A country that's serious about advancing ambitious ends in the world - defending minority religions or, say, brokering peace and transforming impoverished countries, or even fighting a just war - requires a public culture that can properly assess happenings beyond North America, and can support sustained engagement by Canada beyond our borders. More concretely, it needs the practical capabilities to advance these ends: talent (in key positions), assets (intelligence, military, diplomatic), money and, to be sure, differentiated relationships with players in the world.</p><p>To be a leader not only in the Americas but also in the world, Canada needs more foreign affairs culture, and certainly more capabilities. We might start by creating that army of Spanish and Portuguese speakers that the federal government surely requires to advance its stated ends. Let's add some Mandarin and Arabic speakers for good measure.</p><p>None of this is possible without a brave political leadership that applies pressure over time to build the culture and capabilities today that will allow us to score major foreign policy achievements in the long term. But we can be confident that transformation of the Canadian means to regularly realize great projects in the world will make small potatoes of the current argument over the Office of Religious Freedom.</p><p>Irvin Studin is editor-in-chief and publisher of Global Brief magazine.

A deeper look suggests otherwise.</p><p>Ms. Redford tucked into a majority government in the final days of the last election, as voters fled from the Wildrose Party rather than necessarily to Ms. Redford's Progressive Conservatives. Nonetheless, she put together a coalition that proved a winner. She assembled a government from re-elected MLAs and cabinet ministers, none of whom had supported her leadership aspirations, and some new faces.</p><p>She's safely in office for at least another three years, and Alberta's economy remains the envy of every other province, except maybe Saskatchewan. So what's the worry?</p><p>Start at the top. It turns out Ms. Redford is tough to work for and with. Staff turnover has been a problem and, by privately conveyed accounts, ministers and MLAs are frustrated with her one-person style of decision-making. She has to learn that she's the leader, yes, but the leader of a team.</p><p>Across the aisle, Wildrose Leader Danielle Smith is learning from her mistakes as a rookie leader of a new party, just as Stephen Harper did when he led his Conservatives into their first election. Wildrose candidates won't be freelancing any more, as a few did in the last election. Ms. Smith herself won't be so ideologically blind as to insist that global warming is unproven and that the human use of fossil fuels doesn't cause it. Too many Albertans thought that position incredible - and dangerous, too, for a province already under worldwide scrutiny for its emissions.</p><p>The last Alberta budget predicted 'elevated oil prices' and 'continued investment in the energy sector.' Yes, investment is obviously occurring, but big bitumen projects are being scaled back. Why? Because many of the long-held assumptions underpinning energy in Alberta are now shaky. New shale gas production across North America is hammering down natural gas prices, something that will obviously have a depressing impact on the industry in Alberta. Shale oil production in the U.S. and coming mileage improvements for cars are calling into question the axiomatic assumption in Alberta that if you pump it, the Americans will buy it.</p><p>The likely good news is that the re-elected Barack Obama will now approve the Keystone XL pipeline to take Alberta oil to Gulf of Mexico refineries, although there's an off chance that the President will feel he owes something to his environmental backers and that blocking Keystone might be it.</p><p>As for those tantalizing Asian markets, they may still be hungry for Alberta oil, but how does Alberta gets it there? The Enbridge pipeline across northern British Columbia, now before the National Energy Board, is dead politically. Even the Harper government's ministers are starting to slightly modulate their hell-bent support for the project, presumably because they can sense the political winds in B.C.</p><p>Another pipeline alternative - Trans Mountain's down the Fraser River Valley to Vancouver - might be a better bet, but it remains years away from construction. Rail shipments of bitumen oil are rising, and the wind is up for shipping oil to more easterly parts of Canada.</p><p>Ms. Redford has not helped her province's cause. True, she can't be seen as a shill for the oil industry and, true, B.C. Premier Christie Clark's recent trip to Alberta was more a political stunt than anything else, but the Alberta Premier has proven tone-deaf to B.C.'s legitimate concerns about the pipeline.</p><p>The greatest fun at this weekend's Calgary convention will be internal party politics. A majority of Harper MPs from Alberta backed Wildrose in the spring provincial election, a natural fit because so many of them are old Reform Party people. Needless to say, this enraged many of Ms. Redford's Progressive Conservatives.</p><p>A motion is on the agenda to take away from federal Conservatives their automatic right to be members of the provincial Conservatives. As always, the nastiest politics in Alberta are inside the conservative tent.</p>, <p>The Toronto and Ottawa Supervised Consumption Assessment study, released on Wednesday, is noted as the most comprehensive study ever done before setting up such a service.</p><p>Vancouver's Dr. Peter Centre, an HIV/AIDS health-care facility, was part of the study's review.</p><p>Nestled in the city's downtown West End neighbourhood, the building is an architecturally eye-catching merge of modern and heritage house, on a streetscape of heritage houses. It's also a quiet icon of what can happen when a community extends itself to accommodate progressive health care - care that includes supervised injection service.</p><p>Peter Jepson-Young was a young, gay Vancouver physician who died of AIDS 20 years ago, a time when one did not disclose being gay, let alone having HIV/AIDS. His was an act of courage - he appeared on the CBC's supper-hour news once a week for two years to share with British Columbians his experience living and dying with AIDS. The public responded with compassion.</p><p>Today, the Dr. Peter Centre is responding to new challenges in HIV/AIDS care - care for individuals in the vortex of HIV/AIDS, hepatitis C, serious mental illness and addictions, recurring homelessness, and medical instability.</p><p>It's no ordinary health clinic. It's a therapeutic milieu of support, engaging individuals who generally steer clear of traditional health-care facilities. There are nutritious breakfasts and lunches, relaxing spaces, and a culture of respect and acceptance. Nurses assist with daily medication, wound care, and symptom management. Counsellors and music, art and recreation therapists respond to long-standing trauma, grief and loss, mental illness, suicidal thoughts, and the recurring problematic use of alcohol and drugs.</p><p>Adherence to HIV treatment can mean a near-normal lifespan, and recent research shows that individuals who maintain a regular HIV medication regime are 96 per cent less likely to transmit the virus. But medication adherence is an incredibly difficult challenge for the Dr. Peter Centre's at-risk clients. Our integrated care model has helped many with adherence to HIV treatment and is recognized by leading HIV researchers, policy-makers and health-care providers for this success.</p><p>Many of the centre's clients have been to detox and abstinence treatment numerous times. Their desire to achieve long-term abstinence still burns within. The clinical team is there to counsel and support individuals in managing their addictions day to day and longer term, including working on abstinence. When the person expresses a readiness to go to detox and abstinence-based treatment, clinicians are there to help make it happen.</p><p>It's when abstinence is not the reality of a person's life that supervised injection service can be a lifesaver. The Dr. Peter Centre integrated the service 10 years ago. Our galvanizing impetus was two overdoses at the centre - one in a bathroom and another in the laundry room - fortunately, neither fatal. There had never - and still hasn't - been an overdose death in any of the supervised injection sites anywhere in the world.</p><p>The Dr. Peter Centre started the service after the College of Registered Nurses of British Columbia confirmed that it was within the scope of nursing practice to supervise injections for the purposes of preventing illness and promoting health.</p><p>Directly observing injections makes it possible for nurses to teach improved injection techniques to minimize harm to skin and veins, and to teach use of sterile equipment. This reduces repeated infections, which sometimes lead to hospitalization when infections spread to internal organs.</p><p>Supervised injection service has another benefit - we are good neighbours. Our clients do not need to leave the Dr. Peter Centre with clean needles to inject outside. Nobody wants the indignity of publicly injecting; nobody wants to witness it.</p><p>The centre shares a neighbourhood block with more than 300 residents. At the front of the centre is a neighbourhood park with a playground, dog park, community garden, and an elementary school. Partway down the block is a daycare, and another on a side street. On Saturdays, from late spring to early fall, a farmers' market lines our street. And one street away is one of downtown Vancouver's most prestigious hotel and condo residences.</p><p>We don't just co-exist in the city - we thrive. The Dr. Peter Centre's services are possible with nearly $1-million of annual donor support, to complement core government funding. The 100-plus volunteers include corporate staff who serve breakfast once a week. The gifts of kindness and generosity from individuals and businesses are boundless.</p><p>The Dr. Peter Centre experience reflects the best of humanity - an inclusive, compassionate community response to human suffering in our midst. As Toronto, Ottawa, Montreal, Victoria and other Canadian cities engage in conversations about integration of supervised injection service into their health care and communities, it may be helpful to remember the words of Nelson Mandela: 'Many things seem impossible, until they're done.'</p><p>Maxine Davis is executive director of the Vancouver-based Dr. Peter AIDS Foundation.</p>, <p>If you wave around a loaded weapon, eventually you're going to shoot yourself in the foot.</p><p>Sun News, the attack-dog cable channel that launched last April, has built a nascent brand out of claiming Canada for itself. Almost a year before it hit the airwaves with an orchestral rendition ofO Canada, it put out a promo spot featuring scenes of pond hockey, snowshoeing and Banff National Park with a voiceover that declared: 'This is Canada. ... We're the True North strong and free, and the greatest place on Earth.' The ad concluded by promising viewers Sun News would be 'a channel as strong and proud as the country we love.'</p><p>It turns out that owning Canada is a lot more complicated than wrapping yourself in the flag and mouthing a few stock phrases that even the ad agency for Tim Hortons wouldn't go near.</p><p>On Thursday, Sun News 'fessed up that a citizenship affirmation ceremony it staged in its downtown Toronto studio last October was fraudulent. While viewers were told the 10 people who pronounced the oath were new Canadians, six were actually federal bureaucrats faking it for the cameras. Despite weeks of effort, producers had been unable to scare up 10 real Canadians for the ceremony.</p><p>While it had the option of attending an actual citizenship ceremony - four were taking place in Toronto alone - that would probably have made for boring television. Far better to have a quick hit and get on to the next item. So the Ministry of Citizenship and Immigration had helped them out, with a nudge and a wink.</p><p>When the story broke, other journalists lit up their Twitter accounts with glee, while many of those at the Sun Media parent chain stayed uncharacteristically silent. On Thursday morning, one of the channel's newsmen who had anchored the faux ceremony accepted an apology from a spokeswoman for the ministry. 'It would seem that both of us have a little egg on our face,' Pat Bolland acknowledged.</p><p>The incident may just be a rookie error, the result of a new channel scrambling to do interesting programming on a shoestring budget. But it unintentionally points to a broader shift on the Canadian television and political landscape.</p><p>Canadians are notorious for quiet patriotism. We turn up our noses at the flag-waving impulses of our cousins to the south. But as the cultural flood from the rest of the world swamps our homes through the Internet, Canadian broadcasters have launched a patriotic arms race as a way of standing out against the foreign onslaught. And with Stephen Harper's government reaffirming ties to traditional icons such as the Royal Family, it doesn't hurt those broadcasters - who increasingly depend for their survival on strong government protection - to play the Canada card.</p><p>By the end of this weekend, viewers tuning in to CTV and TSN may already be tired of seeing Canadian flags, as the networks kick off a six-month orgy of promotion to get viewers excited about the Olympics. 'Canadians are walking a little taller, a little prouder,' the actress Ellen Page declares in a voiceover as we glimpse waving flags and red-and-white-clad rowers. The spot concludes by promising a very Lester B. Pearson sort of Games: 'Be there as the nations of the world gather to raise their flags in victory, while celebrating in peace.'</p><p>CBC, too, plays up its Canadian identity. It has a prime-time English TV schedule that is almost exclusively domestic, and deep connections in communities across the country. It provided live coverage of a real Ottawa citizenship ceremony right around the time Sun News was showing its made-for-TV production.</p><p>On Thursday afternoon, Sun News announced that the producer who had set up the fake ceremony had in fact left the channel last November. She now works for the CBC.</p>, <p>It runs the risk of playing like satire.</p><p>As Ontario's high-school teachers cancel extracurricular activities and elementary teachers threaten to walk off the job, Dalton McGuinty is trying to launch a discussion about how to better teach emotional intelligence in the province's classrooms.</p><p>Provincial officials concede that the imminent release of 'From Great to Excellent,' a discussion paper by Mr. McGuinty's longtime education adviser Michael Fullan, is less than ideal. But the document, and the circumstances around it, will say a great deal about the self-styled 'Education Premier' - about what mostly worked very well for him over the past decade, and why he's not able to finish building a legacy the way he wanted.</p><p>Mr. McGuinty is genuinely an education policy wonk, and a heady speech last week setting up Mr. Fullan's report signalled that he hasn't lost any enthusiasm for tackling what he considers the big questions.</p><p>'Let's be honest about the challenges our kids are going to face,' he told the Learning Partnership Education Summit, before rhyming off a list that included growing the provincial economy, shrinking the gap between rich and poor, solving climate change, reducing global conflict and accelerating 'scientific and technological breakthroughs' to improve 'the human condition.'</p><p>To give students the tools they need, Mr. McGuinty said, the province will need to 'go beyond high standards in reading, writing and arithmetic,' and 'reach higher by fully embracing higher order skills,' such as creativity, critical thinking, empathy, adaptability and leadership.</p><p>The speech didn't offer many answers about how that's supposed to happen, and Mr. Fullan's report will be similarly light on specifics, making broad recommendations such as better incorporating technology into classrooms, finding new ways to teach collaboration, and further shifting toward 'inquiry-based' early learning.</p><p>If that all seems a little overly abstract, officials insist it's the sort of thing needed to catch the attention of the education-policy apparatus and nudge it toward designing policies that can be implemented. A few of Ontario's school boards are already experimenting with ways of encouraging the 'focused innovation' that Mr. Fullan will call for, they say; the trick is to turn it into a more systemic effort.</p><p>Mr. McGuinty hoped to see that through himself. Now, the cruel reality is that even an interested successor could have rather a tough time taking it on. Because after his first two mandates created a climate that might allow this sort of agenda to take root, the turmoil of his abortive third one could prevent it from ever moving beyond lofty rhetoric.</p><p>It is too simplistic to suggest, as many have, that Mr. McGuinty's perceived education success can be chalked up only to throwing buckets of money into the system. His outreach to Mr. Fullan and other international education gurus (many of whom had worked with Tony Blair's government in the United Kingdom) played a big role in the improved literacy and numeracy test scores the Premier is fond of citing.</p><p>If the splashy spending didn't fully account for the improvements, it certainly facilitated them. By giving teachers generous salary increases and smaller class sizes, the government was able to get co-operation with various changes it wanted them to take on, many of them around intervention with students at risk of slipping through the cracks.</p><p>Now, in a matter of months, that goodwill has evaporated. Blame teachers for resisting wage restraint at a time when the government is $14-billion in deficit; blame Mr. McGuinty's Liberals for the gratuitously confrontational way they tried to cram new contracts down teachers' throats, which the Premier himself has said he regrets. Either way, the atmosphere is now nearly as toxic as it was during the Mike Harris era.</p><p>At this point, Mr. McGuinty has to be worried about backsliding on what he's achieved to date. Trying to get teachers to take a leadership role in adopting newly sophisticated teaching methods would be an almost laughable proposition until the relationship has been rebuilt.</p><p>That shift toward teaching kids to better engage with the world around them, in other words, will have to wait until the adults learn to play nice again.</p>, <p>The war on drugs doesn't just cause human misery. It contributes to the political instability of many parts of the world, including Mexico, Central America and now West Africa.</p><p>The transnational criminal groups in control of the drug trade have successfully destabilized transit countries that stand between production and the market in Europe and North America. This underscores the unintended consequences of prohibition: the growth of a huge criminal black market financed by the profits of supplying demand for illegal drugs, and the 'balloon' effect, whereby drug production and transit corridors shift location to avoid law enforcement. The war on drugs is inherently unwinnable, as the recent report from the Global Commission on Drug Policy concludes.</p><p>Central America has emerged as the new epicentre in the illicit trade, as Mexican cartels are increasingly squeezed by President Felipe Calderon's military initiative against them. There has been an extraordinary surge in crime in El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras, including kidnapping, drug trafficking and migrant smuggling. The drug economy in Guatemala is equal to twice the country's officially recognized GDP. No wonder Central American leaders are demanding reforms to global drug policy.</p><p>Drug money is also perverting weak economies in West Africa, which has become a major transit repackaging hub for South American cocaine destined for Europe. There are fears it could next become a transit zone for cannabis.</p><p>Decriminalizing marijuana would substantially reduce the drug cartels' power and wealth; cannabis accounts for 25 per cent to 40 per cent of cartels' revenues. The resources of law enforcement should be reserved to battle the organized criminals who control the trade, and not wasted on individual drug users who cause harm only to themselves.</p><p>Countries such as Mali, Guinea Bissau and Liberia are ill-equipped to confront drug traffickers, and the judiciary and police are vulnerable to corruption. Cocaine seizures are worth more than some countries' entire security budgets. 'Narco-traffic threatens to metastasize into broader policy and security challenges,' notes the commission's report.</p><p>Why should fragile states continue to bear the brunt of a futile anti-narcotics crusade? Instead, the world should strengthen the defences of states under attack, and help them build alternatives to the drug trade. Consumer countries should focus on reducing demand. Prohibition is far from being an adequate answer.</p>, <p>Canadians following the Republican race for the presidential nomination might well be puzzled: the party of big business and free enterprise savaging its front-runner as a heartless capitalist exploiter, sounding more like the Occupy Wall Street protesters than Republicans; the party of the American Empire and the interventionist foreign policy of George Bush and Dick Cheney with a candidate (Ron Paul) who fires up his followers with a defence of isolationism that Michael Moore joked sounded like it was lifted from him.</p><p>What happened to the Republican Party we thought we knew?</p><p>Actually, all of these positions - and contradictions - go back to the American Founding. Thomas Jefferson fervently wished America to avoid foreign entanglements, restricting its contact with the outside world to trade. But he avidly sought America's own internal empire through westward expansion. The tension between Main Street (the small-town world of agriculture and local business) and Wall Street (high-stakes investment) was etched in the American psyche early on. And both Republicans and Democrats have embraced one or the other tendencies.</p><p>By the time of Theodore Roosevelt's presidency, many believed America's international trade should be accompanied by the projection of military power abroad - in America's self-interest and to spread the ideals of American liberty. Both Republicans and Democrats have embraced an interventionist foreign policy.</p><p>Beginning with Woodrow Wilson, then from FDR through Harry Truman down to JFK and LBJ, the Democrats were the party of hawkish interventionism. When the debacle of Vietnam spiralled the Democrats toward hair-shirt pacifists such as George McGovern and Jimmy Carter, those who remained hawks began gravitating toward the Republicans, joined by younger neo-Wilsonian idealists such as Elliot Abrams and Paul Wolfowitz. The neo-conservatives, as they came to be known, found in the presidencies of Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan and the two Bushes vehicles for the interventionism that the Democrats had abandoned. Only with Bill Clinton did the Democrats return to the foreign policy hawkishness they had once dominated.</p><p>During the FDR-LBJ period, the Republican Party had increasingly become the home of the old isolationist streak that wanted to avoid involvement in what George Washington had called 'foreign wars,' crystallized in Dwight Eisenhower's warning about the 'military-industrial complex.' Even under hawkish Republican presidents from Mr. Nixon onward, that isolationism never went away. Similarly, when Mr. Clinton intervened in Kosovo, Republicans began complaining - as Mr. Paul does now - that America should not be the 'world's policeman.' When George W. Bush invaded both Afghanistan and Iraq, many heartland Republicans followed him only reluctantly, mainly out of their personal affection for him.</p><p>In the realm of economic policy, there has been a similar back and forth between the two parties. It was Republican Theodore Roosevelt who decried 'the malefactors of great wealth,' favouring the break-up of monopolies and stealing the populist thunder of William Jennings Bryan for his own party's advantage. With FDR and the New Deal, help for the little man moved over to the Democrats. Neither party ever truly turned its back on Wall Street in favour of an exclusive concern with Main Street. But in general tone and temperament, it's fair to say that Mr. Nixon, Mr. Reagan and both Bushes were more Main Street presidents, while the Clinton and Obama administrations have been intimately connected to Wall Street.</p><p>In the current Republican presidential primaries, in the absence of a strong and effective leader such as Mr. Reagan or George W. Bush, all of these differing policies have come flying apart. Mr. Paul's isolationism appeals to a long-standing constituency in the party. The savaging of Mitt Romney as a corporate raider and high-finance shark taps into the party's deep ambivalence about 'New York' venture capitalism and its preference for rural and small business Main Street populism. The fundamentalist Christian strain of that heartland leaning - a powerful base of support for both Mr. Reagan and Mr. Bush - has propelled Rick Santorum's candidacy.</p><p>Can anyone put these pieces together again? Only an effective leader will be able to reunite them in such a way that all groups will feel they're getting something of what they want. But that leader has yet to emerge. Mr. Reagan ran to the right and governed from the centre, uniting Main Street rhetoric with Wall Street backing. Mr. Bush was perhaps more truly Main Street in both rhetoric and policies but was also the biggest interventionist hawk of them all. His popularity based on a heartland constituency that remained deeply ambivalent about 'foreign wars,' he used his presidency after 9/11 to allow the neo-con firebrands previously restrained by his father and Mr. Reagan to have complete sway.</p><p>This capacity to combine contradictory values and policies into a coherent political coalition bridging the divisions between Main Street and Wall Street, isolationist and hawk, is the sign of real leadership. The current factions have spun off, uniting only to savage Mr. Romney. Should he be the nominee, it will be a long and slow haul for him to rise above the fray and bring the squabblers into a big political tent.</p><p>Waller Newell is a professor of political science and philosophy at Carleton University.</p>, <p>Canada ranks higher than most other countries for its spending on health care, though the days of big increases are coming to an end. Austerity, which is a global phenomenon in health care, should be embraced as an opportunity to innovate.</p><p>Recent figures from the Organisation for Economic Development and Co-operation show Canada is the fifth highest spender of health as a share of its gross domestic product [11.4 per cent in 2010] and seventh highest on health expenditures per capita [$4,445 U.S. in 2010] - both higher than the OECD average of 34 member countries.</p><p>And yet for all that money, there are still troubling access issues: only about half of sick patients are able to see a doctor the same or next day, the wait times for specialists are long and there are too many avoidable emergency room visits. Many patients find the system unnecessarily difficult to navigate.</p><p>The system's 1950s acute-care model is not equipped to deal with the burgeoning group of aging patients whose multiple chronic conditions demand comprehensive care, not repeated physician visits in a fragmented system.</p><p>Despite that, Canadians often enjoy a feeling of superiority when comparing this country's health spending to that of the United States. But it's easy to compare yourself to the worst country in terms of health care spending. The U.S. is highest in both categories of health expenditures as share of GDP [17.6 per cent] and per capita [$8,233].</p><p>This should not obscure the fact that Canada also spends more than it can afford.</p><p>Transformative change to health care doesn't typically take place in good times, when the system is awash in cash. Rather, the necessary impetus for change is now, in an age of cost containment.</p><p>Provinces need to examine whether they are getting value for money. Hospitals need to find new ways to innovate. Mergers and partnerships need to be sought. Patients need to demand a better experience. That will all help to improve the system.</p><p>And governments need to go further by expanding the role of the private sector. Its ability to generate efficiencies to help deliver publicly-funded health services could play a key role in ensuring a strong system is passed to the next generation.</p>, <p>Arthur Donner and Doug Peterargued in Monday's Globe and Mail that Canada's current account deficit 'is far more serious than the fiscal problems facing the federal government,' asserting that the CA deficit 'represents a leakage of output, jobs and incomes to other countries.'</p><p>This is a popular view that is repeated frequently by public opinion leaders in Canada and elsewhere. It is also incorrect, as a brief perusal of any textbook discussion of international trade will confirm. These arguments are based on mercantilism, a theory that was debunked two centuries ago by David Ricardo.</p><p>Until interplanetary trade becomes a reality, the sum of all countries' current account balances must be zero: Deficits in one country are offset by surpluses in another. The notion that a CA deficit is a 'leakage of output' is derived from the broader misconception that international trade is a zero-sum game in which imports are losses to be avoided and exports are gains to be pursued.</p><p>This is exactly wrong. The reason why we engage in international trade is to obtain things more cheaply than we can produce them for ourselves. The real benefits from trade are imports; exports are the price we pay for those imports. Moreover, the gains are not zero-sum - both sides benefit.</p><p>In a world where capital is not free to cross borders, the current account will always be zero: Goods must be paid for with other goods. So the best way to look at Canada's CA is not in terms of flows of goods, but in terms of flows of capital.</p><p>The current account represents the net change in Canada's international investment position. A negative CA means that Canadian asset holdings abroad fell, foreign holdings in Canada increased, or some combination of the two. The CA can also be viewed as the net international transfer of savings, and is negative when foreigners shift more of their savings to Canada than Canadians send abroad.</p><p>A national accounting identity states that total investment expenditure must be financed by the sum of domestic and foreign savings. Noting that Canada has a current account deficit is the same thing as noting that investment expenditures are larger than domestic savings - the difference is made up by foreign investors.</p><p>Capital inflows are not always benign. Foreign savings helped fuel a U.S. housing bubble and contributed to the financial crisis there. Sudden and large inflows of 'hot money' have often been destabilizing in countries whose financial markets are not sufficiently well-developed to absorb them. But if foreign savings serve to finance the creation of new productive capacity, then their effect is positive: Output, productivity and wages in Canada will increase.</p><p>The available evidence favours the good-news scenario. Investment grew more rapidly than GDP during the 2002-08 expansion, and expenditures on machinery and equipment have recovered their prerecession peak. The Bank of Canada's recent Business Outlook Survey suggests that firms intend to invest more in the future.</p><p>So what would happen if the Bank of Canada decided to abandon its inflation target and work to depreciate the Canadian dollar? Canadian goods would become cheaper on world markets - and so would Canadian assets. The increase in foreign demand for Canadian goods would be accompanied by an increase in the foreign demand for Canadian assets.</p><p>The main obstacle to larger and potentially destabilizing inflows of foreign capital is the exchange rate; a high value of the Canadian dollar acts as a deterrent to foreign investors. A policy-engineered depreciation would accelerate capital inflows and could end up fuelling an asset price bubble.</p><p>Rebalancing the CA requires a combination of reducing investment, cutting back on consumer spending or increased government austerity. This may happen eventually, or maybe not - we've run a CA deficit for most of our history. But forcing a premature rebalancing will likely do more harm than good.</p><p>Stephen Gordon is a professor of economics at Laval University in Quebec City and a fellow of the Centre interuniversitaire sur le risque, les politiques economiques et l'emploi (CIRPEE).</p>, <p>In the very near future, we'll all be able to have our entire genome - all our genetic information - mapped for under $1,000. This is an astonishing scientific development. The Human Genome Project cost billions. Soon, you'll be able to get your very own genome sequenced for the price of a laptop.</p><p>It has been suggested that this technological advance will usher in a new health-care 'revolution.' It will allow us, or so it's promised, to individualize health-care treatments and preventive strategies - an approach often called 'personalized medicine.' It will allow us to become fully aware of our genetic shortcomings and the diseases for which we're at increased genetic risk, thus providing the impetuous to adopt healthier lifestyles.</p><p>But will having your personal genome available really revolutionize your health-care world? Will you be able to use this information to significantly improve your chances of avoiding the most common chronic diseases? Not likely.</p><p>Tangible benefits will be (and have been) achieved. But, for the most part, these advances are likely to be incremental in nature - which, history tells us, is the way scientific progress usually unfolds.</p><p>Why this 'we are not in a revolution' message? Overselling the benefits of personal genomics can hurt the science, by creating unrealistic expectations, and distract us from other, more effective areas of health promotion.</p><p>The relationship between our genome and disease is far more complicated than originally anticipated. Indeed, the more we learn about the human genome, the less we seem to know. For example, results from a major international initiative to explore all the elements of our genome (the ENCODE project) found that, despite decades-old conventional wisdom that much of our genome was nothing but 'junk DNA,' as much as 80 per cent of our genome likely has some biological function. This work hints that things are much more convoluted than expected. So much so that one of ENCODE's lead researchers, Yale's Mark Gerstein, was quoted as saying that it's 'like opening a wire closet and seeing a hairball of wires.'</p><p>Given this complexity, it's no surprise that the personal health value of genomic information, particularly in relation to common diseases, remains questionable. Beyond the comparatively rare single-gene diseases (Huntington's, cystic fibrosis etc.) and a handful of relatively predictive cancer genes, the kind of genetic information you get from a personal genome scan simply isn't that predictive, especially when compared with the prognostic tools we already have - such as the weigh scale, tape measure and blood pressure cuff.</p><p>Perhaps more important, there isn't much we can do with the genetic information. While progress is being made in areas such as pharmacogenetics - tailoring drug therapies based on an individual's genes - the advances haven't come at revolutionary speed. For example, a study published a few months ago, described as the 'largest body of pharmacogenetic data available to date,' found that, in the context of depression drugs, 'none of the more than 500,000 genetic markers predicted treatment outcome.' These results are, as suggested by the study authors, pretty sobering.</p><p>What about lifestyle change? The promotion of healthier lifestyles and preventive strategies are some of the most often articulated benefits of personal genomics. But there's little evidence that people can and will change their behaviour based on genetic risk information. A 2011 systematic review of all the available data found that the communication of genetic risk information 'may have little or no effect on behaviour.' And a 2012 study found that 'genomic profiling for cancer risk prediction' is unlikely to have any significant impact on health.</p><p>You don't need to get your genome decoded to know you should exercise regularly, eat lots of fruits and vegetables and maintain a healthy weight. These are the kind of basic strategies (and the good sense to be born to wealthy and well-educated parents) that have the biggest impact. These actions don't need to be 'personalized' through a high-tech and largely uninterpretable test.</p><p>For more than two decades, we've been told that we're in the midst of a genetic revolution. I'm still waiting. Meantime, if we really want to revolutionize our health, we should all put down the gene sequencers, fries and pop, pick up an apple and go for a brisk walk.</p><p>Timothy Caulfield is Canada Research Chair in Health, Law and Policy at the University of Alberta and author of The Cure for Everything: Untangling the Twisted Messages about Health, Fitness and Happiness.</p>, <p>The real decision that Stephen Harper needs to make about deals like the Chinese takeover of Calgary-based oil firm Nexen is whether he can use them as a bargaining chip.</p><p>Mr. Harper must make a call soon on whether he allows China's CNOOC Ltd. to buy Nexen for $15.1-billion, and in the process, he's promising to set out new guidelines for foreign takeovers.</p><p>The business community and the NDP are calling for the murky rules for foreign-investment approvals to be clarified. Still, when it comes to state-owned enterprises, the rules must leave enough room to apply a little leverage. China, after all, would do the same.</p><p>'Let's be more Chinese in the way we negotiate,' said Fen Hampson, a distinguished fellow at the Centre for International Governance Innovation, and a Carleton University professor.</p><p>Along with three widely respected co-authors, Prof. Hampson wrote a report on new strategies to expand trade in emerging markets - Winning in a Changing World - which is getting close scrutiny inside Mr. Harper's government. It calls for clearer foreign-investment rules, but also for Canada to use such foreign investments for leverage, to try to pry open the doors for Canadian investors in China and other emerging markets.</p><p>Up to now, Canadian reviews of foreign takeovers have, at least in theory, been based simply on whether the deal is economically good for Canada - whether it will create jobs or wealth here.</p><p>For most takeover bids by private companies, that's the right test. And it's a good idea to clarify the black-box process for applying that 'net benefit' test, so potential investors aren't discouraged by seemingly arbitrary Canadian reviews.</p><p>But state-owned enterprises are different because they are the arms of foreign governments. Sometimes that matters. Their takeovers raise fears that foreign governments could try to hoard resources or manipulate markets or use their economic power in Canada to influence Ottawa. The Canadian Security Intelligence Service warned in September that some state firms get spy help from their governments; Canada would have to expect to spend more on counterespionage.</p><p>Chinese takeovers are unpopular. Mr. Harper could just flatly reject them. But he doesn't want to signal that Canada is closed to all Chinese business or state-owned firms. He's more likely to set rules to limit them, perhaps preventing state firms from dominating sectors, like oil, and applying conditions on Canadian involvement in the companies.</p><p>But there's something else Canada dearly wants, too - more access to invest and trade in foreign markets. And right now Canada has something China and other countries want - a stable market from which to buy resources. Ottawa can use this to apply a little leverage.</p><p>That doesn't mean Canada should ask for a quid pro quo every time it reviews a foreign takeover by a state company. Instead, said Len Edwards, former deputy minister of foreign affairs and co-author of the Winning in a Changing World report, a new policy for such takeovers should state that approval depends in part on whether Canadians have had success in investing in their country.</p><p>That might sound esoteric, Mr. Edwards said, but it would have an impact when state-owned firms from China or another country want to buy a Canadian company: ' Now they're looking over their shoulder and saying, 'Okay, what have we done for the Canadians in the last little while? Anything at all?' '</p><p>Prof. Hampson said he thinks the investment reviews should allow for a variety of conditions for state-owned enterprises, so that instead of just approving or rejecting a takeover, Ottawa could, for example, insist on a Chinese company entering a joint venture with a Canadian one. That's what the Chinese do with us.</p><p>Then, the governments that own state firms trying to buy Canadian resources will understand they have to offer more of what Canada wants to close a deal.</p><p>Campbell Clark writes about foreign affairs from Ottawa</p>, <p>All political parties are coalitions, including the New Democratic Party, so it is hardly surprising that divisions have emerged in the NDP's coalition as its leadership campaign reaches a climax.</p><p>These latent divisions are made more acute by the NDP's unexpected proximity to office. With one more push, the party tells itself, the New Jerusalem of power might soon be at hand - a prospect no previous group of New Democrats could ever truthfully tell itself. What compromises or changes of style might be needed for that final push are matters close to the heart of the campaign. Most candidates say no changes are required, but several, especially Thomas Mulcair, hint that a few are required.</p><p>It seems obvious to outsiders, and to the largest number of NDP voters, that Mr. Mulcair is the leadership candidate best positioned for the final push, because every party has to update itself to win.</p><p>Moreover, we are in the Stephen Harper age of politics, which means unbridled partisanship and generalized nastiness, epitomized between elections by negative attack ads on the character, integrity and record of opposition leaders.</p><p>Former Liberal leaders Stephane Dion and Michael Ignatieff were subjected to these assaults. Now, 'interim' leader Bob Rae is receiving the same treatment - with the Liberals a mere third party. It will just be a matter of time before the Conservative attack machine directs its fire at the NDP's new leader.</p><p>Amid such generalized nastiness, a sad question arises: Who, among the NDP hopefuls, can best take these assaults and return fire? The answer seems evident: Mr. Mulcair. He is the most combative, argumentative, bilingual and quick-tongued candidate. Whether that would make him the best party leader over time, let alone prime minister of Canada some day, is another matter.</p><p>Evidently, former NDP leader Ed Broadbent does not think so. He supports party backroom boy Brian Topp and launched a very nasty attack of his own this week against Mr. Mulcair, with the approval and advance knowledge of the Topp campaign - a clear sign of panic, perhaps even desperation.</p><p>Essentially, Mr. Broadbent said Mr. Mulcair could not be trusted to lead the party because of character flaws and a desire to take the party toward the 'centre' of the political spectrum, wherever that 'centre' is at a time of diminishing utility of political labelling.</p><p>These were serious charges that reflected the nervousness many New Democrats feel about Mr. Mulcair: that he is somehow not of the NDP faith; that he will sell out that faith (as defined by Mr. Broadbent) in the push for power; that he is not sufficiently respectful of the party and its traditions; that his ego and temper makes him unfit to lead.</p><p>Quite obviously, the largest number of New Democrats don't buy this critique or feel these putative weaknesses are more than compensated for by Mr. Mulcair's obvious virtues, notably that he can hold the party's ephemeral support in Quebec, recast NDP verities in a modern vernacular, beat back a Liberal resurgence under Mr. Rae, the best debater in Canadian politics - and, most critically, give as good as he gets from Mr. Harper's attack machine.</p><p>Mr. Topp, like Mr. Mulcair, speaks excellent French, having grown up in the province. But he is without a Commons seat, has no elected political experience, did not distinguish himself in the debates and has thus far not developed the public skills to suggest a fair fight with Mr. Harper or Mr. Rae. That he has intelligence and strategic sense is undeniable, to which can be added the desire to keep steady the NDP's policy direction and its enduring relationship with the trade unions.</p><p>This makes Mr. Topp a safe choice for those who believe that a steady-as-she-goes approach will best position the party for that final push to power. He is, therefore, the candidate who thinks the country is coming to the NDP, as opposed to Mr. Mulcair, who thinks the party still needs to come to the country.</p>, <p>Colombia's Supreme Court has done an admirable job prosecuting a complex corruption case against former government officials and allies of Alvaro Uribe, the country's ex-president.</p><p>However, the recent removal of the special prosecutor in the case, Ivan Velasquez, just as it closes in on Mr. Uribe's former high-level aides, is an unwelcome reversal.</p><p>If the South American country of 46 million is to re-establish the credibility of its democratic institutions, Mr. Velasquez must be allowed to continue to pursue justice in this case, known as the 'para-politics' scandal.</p><p>'The clean-up of the house has been championed by this judge and his departure is a setback for democracy,' said Jose Miguel Vivanco, with Human Rights Watch.</p><p>Mr. Velasquez was removed by the Supreme Court, and not by President Juan Manuel Santos, who has supported the human rights investigation since he took office in 2010. Already, more than 50 ex-politicians have been prosecuted and sentenced for their links to illegal armed groups known as para-militaries, and for illegal wiretapping. Mr. Uribe's brother, cousin and former chief of staff all face charges. His former intelligence chief fled the country before charges against him were filed. Mr. Uribe has denied any knowledge of the conspiracy.</p><p>While Mr. Santos cannot interfere in the judicial process, he needs to reassure Colombians that his government remains committed to justice and to supporting Mr. Velasquez, who has been the victim of smear campaigns in the past.</p><p>Unlike his predecessor, Mr. Santos has shown a willingness to end the country's internal conflict, and even to negotiate with Marxist rebels, known as the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), who have waged war for more than half a century.</p><p>His commitment to peace should extend to public support for the special prosecutor who has played a crucial role in exposing the abuse of power that permeated Mr. Uribe's government.</p>, <p>This week's visit by German Chancellor Angela Merkel is further proof that Canada is making its presence felt on the global stage for the first time in years. It follows intensive efforts to advance Canada's trade agenda, and builds upon Canada gaining admission to the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade agreement negotiations in late June.</p><p>Prime Minister Stephen Harper's government is also expected to announce the release of a Canada-China economic study shortly setting out the strong rationale for continued efforts toward deepened and strengthened bilateral trade and investment ties. The beginning of Canada-China bilateral trade discussions could be just as historic as Canada's entry into TPP.</p><p>While this level of activity is impressive, Canada has challenges to overcome notwithstanding its ambitions. International Trade Minister Ed Fast and his officials have the difficult job of convincing our trading partners that Canada is committed to achieving the high standards of 21st-century trade agreements that will grow our economy and improve our competitiveness.</p><p>The litmus test for the government's trade efforts lies in clinching a deal with the European Union. Successful conclusion of the comprehensive economic and trade agreement (CETA) negotiations is viewed by many as key to the success of the Prime Minister's larger trade agenda. Hence the importance of this week's visit by Ms. Merkel, whose support is critical to CETA. Concluding CETA would give Canada access to the world's largest common market of 500-million consumers, with economic studies showing an annual boost of $12-billion in economic activity.</p><p>With such significant gains to be had, it is mystifying that one of the remaining issues is reported to be Canada's uncertain commitment to strengthening its intellectual-property standards, which includes harmonizing our life-sciences IP standards to EU standards. If Canada is to be taken seriously by its major trading partners, there can be no doubt about our commitment to upgrading to IP standards commensurate with Canada's position as an innovative economy.</p><p>Canada has a substantial life-sciences research-and-development footprint, which we should be trying to grow because it means more high-value jobs for Canadians. Moreover, the EU values public health care as much as Canada does, and is just as serious about managing its health-care costs. So how does one respond to the fear-mongering over alleged cost increases resulting from harmonization with EU standards? In my estimation, one answers with a question: What have we learned about the health-care cost impacts of IP improvements since the North American free-trade agreement? The answer is that our health-care system was not affected and both Canada's generic and innovative pharmaceutical industries prospered.</p><p>Big trade deals call for big decisions, and the Harper government is nearing the endgame on CETA. It would be a tragedy for Canada to fail in concluding negotiations with the EU over proposals that are in its own interest, only to then face similar proposals made by other nations in the context of other continuing negotiations. It would also confirm our trading partners' doubts about our level of commitment to truly ambitious outcomes.</p><p>I cannot help but think that the Prime Minister has already thought this through and is preparing to take bold steps in the right direction. The timing of Chancellor Merkel's visit could not be better.</p><p>Peter Harder, a former deputy minister of foreign affairs, is senior policy adviser at Fraser Milner Casgrain LLP.</p>, <p>In July, 1910, as Hawley Crippen approached Quebec City by ocean liner, he was arrested for the murder of his wife. His downfall was the emerging technology of the wireless telegraph. Dr. Crippen, the first person to be caught in such a manner, had fled the United Kingdom with his lover, but the wireless telegraph allowed the ship's captain to alert British police, who raced to catch the fugitives at the mouth of the St. Lawrence.</p><p>Much has changed since 1910. We now have technologies of communication that would have seemed unthinkable even 20 years ago. The arrest of Luka Magnotta is a telling illustration of the power of the Internet, a framework of communication that was, in practical terms, only in its infancy in the 1990s.</p><p>As this sordid saga reveals, the Internet can be both lauded and reviled. The global release of photos, videos and stories about an alleged 'Canadian psycho' left the suspect with no place to hide; he was found, appropriately enough, in an Internet cafe in Berlin, surfing for both porn and news about the case.</p><p>But it was also the Internet that is alleged to have provided a platform in this case, providing the opportunity for the broadcast of repulsive videos of sadistic cruelty. Such videos, once released into cyberspace, become almost impossible to recall.</p><p>The other side of this coin, however, is that the suspect's online visibility also served to facilitate his capture. Put differently, every critique of the Internet's porous lack of accountability can be met with the observation that online visibility also shines a light into the darkest recesses of human behaviour.</p><p>Mr. Magnotta has yet to be tried, of course, but the sensational nature of his case is also a depressingly familiar reminder of how most of us come to understand the reality of crime. Only the most horrific and sensational homicide allegations are reported with any detail in the mainstream press, or online. We all know the barbaric deeds of Willie Pickton, Paul Bernardo and Clifford Olson. But the typical homicide - one man stabs a former friend or acquaintance to death in a drunken dispute - receives little or no attention. We learn of the rarest and most predatory of criminal acts, not of the crime staples that populate the lives of our police officers, courts and correctional centres.</p><p>The problem with this selective reporting, based on the understandable principle that the most horrific acts make for better reading, is that extensive coverage of these crimes skews our perceptions of crime and criminals. We overemphasize the predatory offender, relative to the norm of crime: individuals with little intelligence and poor social skills making bad decisions in difficult circumstances, a sad trail of events that are more appropriately described as tragic than as evil. We rarely hear of the reality that 35 per cent of the 13,300 inmates in federal penitentiaries have significant mental-health impairments, and are in need of treatment.</p><p>Given the selective reporting of crime, it is not particularly surprising that Canadians are more likely to believe that crime has increased rather than decreased, and that they are less safe than they were a decade ago. Police data tell us of a very different reality - consistent decreases in both the severity of crime and in the count of the specific crimes of homicide, sexual assault and assault. Unhappily, against this backdrop, our current government is only too happy to stoke the fires of misinformation, catering to the public's misplaced fears. 'Let me be clear,' Stephen Harper told a Winnipeg audience in 2006, 'our government has absolutely no intention of standing by and allowing this plague of violent, organized crime to grow unchecked.'</p><p>Mr. Magnotta's case is a reminder of our myopia and of the media's imperatives. They work to sell a product; education of the public is neither critical nor necessary for this task. And so we have another riveting tale of horror - a haunting and disturbing face atop the front pages and home pages of almost every major newspaper. Sadly, such sensationalism is a feature of crime reporting that seems unlikely to disappear.</p>, <p>The premier of the Sick Man of Canada, Ontario, arrives in the nation's capital Thursday for a major speech. If it's like the speech Premier Dalton McGuinty delivered recently in Toronto, people should turn in their tickets before it's too late.</p><p>That speech was a snoozer at a time when Ontario needs a wake-up call. Ontario, once the golden goose of Canada, is laying an economic egg. Its public services cannot be financed at existing levels of taxation. So Ontario borrows a lot of money, and will keep right on borrowing unless serious remedial measures are taken. Either the government gets both smaller and smarter, or taxes must go up - or both.</p><p>The rest of Canada should take note: Ontario is fiscally crippled and will be for some time. This crippling represents the biggest change within Confederation since the discovery of oil in Alberta.</p><p>The dynamics of the country are changed. Ontario now receives equalization payments and will for the foreseeable future. Not large payments, but payments nonetheless. Symbolically, that says it all.</p><p>Of course, the McGuinty government puts the best gloss possible on the situation. The two opposition parties, regrettably, are into puerile populism of the left and right, with the NDP talking about heating oil rebates for seniors and other irrelevancies, and the Conservatives blathering on about eliminating toothless regional health authorities as a way to save money.</p><p>But the Conference Board of Canada, beholden to no one, has laid it on the line. Its recent report on Ontario's economic and fiscal prospects, combined with economist Don Drummond's report next week (anyone who knows him will anticipate the straight goods), will be a one-two punch against all the illusions, posturing and politicking that have characterized much of what passes for political debate in Ontario.</p><p>The Conference Board's report starts from a devastating premise: Ontario's real economic growth will be 1.9 per cent, almost a full point below the government's projections. As a result, the McGuinty government's plan to wipe out the $16-billion deficit by 2017-2018 is already junk bond stuff.</p><p>The government had predicted it could bring health-care spending increases down to 3 per cent and keep them there (something never before done), limit education and social services to a 2-per-cent increases, and restrict everything else to almost zero.</p><p>Not any more. Slower growth will mean fewer revenues, which will require cutting everything except health, education and social services by 5 per cent. That would mean cutting,inter alia: roads, public transit, legal aid, culture, agriculture, environment, corporate subsidies and grants, research and development - in short, everything else the government does.</p><p>If the government stuck to its original plan, it could balance the books, all right - but in a decade. If, as is likely, it were impossible to hold health care increases to 3 per cent - if health care rose at 4.7 per cent - then the budget would not be balanced in 2011-2012 or any time thereafter. And if health care tracked up to 5.6 per cent yearly increases, then to balance the budget by 2017-2018 the provincial sales tax would have to hit 15 per cent.</p><p>These are projections, albeit it highly intelligent ones. Maybe growth will soar well beyond expectations. Maybe Ontario's public institutions will suddenly become vastly more productive. Maybe public-sector unions will accept five to 10 years of restraint. Maybe a surge of innovation will wash over Ontario; after all, it has large universities, a well-educated population and some world-class companies. Maybe the three parties in a minority government will stop posturing and come together in a serious effort to restore Ontario's fiscal situation. Maybe pigs will sprout wings.</p><p>But after years of the McGuinty government adding new programs everywhere - including the latest one to lop 30 per cent off university tuition fees for many full-time students - while the economy kept slumping, ye olde proverbial chickens have come home to roost. Indeed, they arrived some time ago, but the politicians weren't looking, or pretended not to see.</p><p>And so the Sick Man of Canada, and its premier, now has a choice: Speak the truth about what is really happening and prepare people for what must be done; or give a Toronto speech, evasive, bland and political.</p>, <p>A form letter is being circulated to enable conservative Christian and Muslim parents to ask Ontario public schools to exempt their children from various programs, as an accommodation of their religious faith. A similar letter is at the heart of a Christian family's lawsuit against a southern Ontario school board that refuses to grant the requested exemption. Its core belief is that parents have the right to direct the spiritual and moral education of their education.</p><p>Fair enough. Some exemptions may be reasonable to ask for and receive - from sex education, for instance. But here's the problem: The authors of that form letter define spiritual and moral education so broadly as to encompass a wide swath of the public-school day. In their view, a public-school education delivers, explicitly and implicitly, a religious training of its own - in 'secular humanism.'</p><p>Take discussions about the environment - labelled 'environmental worship,' or 'naturalism.' 'Our faith requires that we place nothing above our God,' says the letter, written by a group that calls itself Public Education Advocates for Christian Equity. 'Meeting expectations of conservation would be more successful, for our children, if connected to their spiritual understanding of being responsible to their Creator.' Any time the environment is to be raised, parents would have to be notified ahead of time. Presumably, spontaneous discussion of the environment would be off limits.</p><p>Or take 'values neutral education - indoctrination of students in 'moral relativism' and principles of situational ethics. This 'ism' is a central tenet of the religion of 'Secular Humanism.'' This may cover nearly any topic imaginable. Perhaps discussion itself is off limits.</p><p>There's a space in the form letter to ask for notification or an exemption from any discussion about homosexual 'conduct or relationships' as 'natural, healthy and acceptable.' Since when does the teaching of 'acceptance' of anyone run counter to parental rights? Should schools be obliged to tell parents about books about gay parents on in-class bookshelves, or of pictures of lesbian mothers or gay dads on the walls? Should children be excused from learning about respect for difference?</p><p>The accommodation sought by these parents would make it difficult for public schools to transmit the curriculum, with its explicit teachings and implicit values. It's not really an accommodation they seek; it's a different program.</p>, <p>If Barack Obama loses the election, my friend Jim will be one reason why.</p><p>Four years ago, Jim voted enthusiastically for hope and change. This year, he's voting for Mitt Romney. 'I like Romney,' he says. 'When folks saw and listened to him right next to Obama, he looked and spoke more like a president than Obama did.'</p><p>Up here in Canada, a large majority of us still belong to the Obama tribe. If Americans were smart enough to think like us, Barack Obama would win by a margin of at least three to one. We can't fathom why fair-minded people would vote for Mitt Romney. Most of my Canadian friends believe that Romney voters are either callous capitalists or dupes and fools - mouth-breathing Tea Partiers, country-club Republicans, closet racists, or working-class types who've been tricked into voting against their own interests.</p><p>Jim is none of these. He was thrilled to help elect the first black president. He choked up at the inauguration. He believes that universal health care is a moral imperative. He thinks the Bush regime's reckless misadventures in foreign lands were total disasters. He believes in a decent safety net and sensible business regulation. But President Obama isn't the postpartisan, centrist bridge-builder he told us he would be. 'Obama is, in fact, a lefty, and given a free hand we really would become a debt-laden, sinking, entitlement-heavy, socialist basket case,' Jim says. </p><p>Mr. Obama's appeal among minorities remains as strong as ever. But white Americans are breaking up with him across the board. In 2008, he was behind by 12 percentage points among white voters. This time, according to a recent Washington Post-ABC tracking poll, he's trailing by 21 percentage points. (Mitt Romney with 59 per cent, Mr. Obama at 38 per cent.)</p><p>Plenty of Americans feel overlooked by both parties. Jennifer Erickson, a married mom in the swing state of Iowa told the Des Moines Register that the way she sees it, Mr. Obama champions the poor and Mr. Romney is for the ultra-rich. 'Either way, the middle class loses.'</p><p>She's not the only one who feels abandoned. The pro-Obama punditocracy is full of misery and reproach. They generally agree that the man in whom they had invested so much hope has been a crushing disappointment. 'Obama never espoused a cause bigger than his own political survival,' wrote Washington Post columnist Richard Cohen in a poignant cri de coeur. 'I will vote for Obama with regret. I wish he was the man I once mistook him for.'</p><p>Camille Paglia is harsher. In her view, the Democratic Party has lost all connection with the working class. As she told Glenn Reynolds, 'I don't see progressives. All I see is white upper-middle-class liberals who speak in this unctuous way about the needs of the poor.' (She's voting green.)</p><p>To Canadians, Mr. Obama's achievement in rectifying the barbarous injustices of the U.S. health-care system is reason enough to re-elect him. Americans don't see it that way, though. A large number of them liked the system pretty much the way it was. They would have preferred small fixes, so that people with pre-existing conditions would be covered and nobody would go bankrupt paying for their kid's cancer treatments. Instead, they got Obamacare - a bloated monster of a bill that only a bureaucrat could love. Nobody understands it and nobody knows how it will play out. Maybe it's better than nothing, and maybe it's worse. At any rate, it will do nothing to control costs, which are soaring.</p><p>But the worst thing about Obamacare was that it was awful politics. By ramming it through Congress when he did, Mr. Obama sacrificed the chance to carry out serious financial reform, and also to build consensus with the Republicans on other vital issues. Obamacare may have been a moral victory, but it was a failure of strategic leadership. As Democratic congressman Barney Frank told New York magazine, 'I think we paid a terrible price for health care.'</p><p>Then came the campaign. Mr. Romney moved to the centre, but Mr. Obama didn't. The President's entire campaign had been built on demonizing his opponent as a charmless, rapacious plutocrat. It all went off the rails when Mr. Romney showed up at the first debate and impersonated a normal human being. Now Mr. Romney's flip-flopping, which used to be regarded as a flaw, has become an asset. Democrats have tried to portray him as a heartless opportunist who will say anything to win. Instead, voters like my friend Jim see him as a pragmatist who will govern from the centre, despite his campaign platform. They also agree with David Brooks, the conservative columnist who used to admire Mr. Obama's temperament and character. Mr. Brooks now says that Mitt Romney is 'more likely to get big stuff done.'</p><p>The trouble is, this time around Mr. Obama hasn't bothered to campaign on the big stuff. He has campaigned on little stuff. We know where he stands on free contraception (not exactly the biggest priority for voters these days), and we know he wants to tax the rich. But what's the long-term plan? What's his vision for the next four years? If he has one, he's kept it to himself. Amazingly, both candidates have managed to spend the entire election campaign avoiding any mention of the fiscal cliff, or the fiscal abyss that America is falling into even if it avoids the fiscal cliff, or the steps the nation will have to take to save itself from economic oblivion. There's a herd of elephants in the room, and they're all invisible.</p><p>The more I listen to my American friends, the more convinced I am that Barack Obama doesn't deserve to win. Sure, he was dealt a rotten hand. But he squandered his political capital and his opportunities. The trouble is, I'm pretty sure the other guy doesn't deserve to win either. Good luck, Jim! You're going to need it.</p>, <p>As night fell so, too, did the thermometer, as a shivering photographer hunkered in the market square across from the Grand Mosque at Djenne, Mali.</p><p>Sean White was in the City of Clay, about 350 kilometres southwest of Timbuktu, to shoot moving images for a television program. As he travelled the globe, it was the Victoria photographer's routine to collect time-lapse images for a personal project. He had yet to develop a concrete idea, but knew he could not pass up the opportunity to gather images in so exotic a locale.</p><p>He had hired some boys to watch the camera overnight, but they tracked him down at his hotel to say they'd been ordered home by their parents. If he wanted images of the mosque, the largest adobe building in the world, Mr. White would have to spend the night outside with the camera.</p><p>'You're in the desert, so in the daytime it's scorching heat,' he said. 'I wasn't prepared for overnight.'</p><p>The city went to sleep, leaving the littered grounds of the central market to animals. Dogs chased each other. Donkeys rolled in the red dirt. Rats scavenged scraps of discarded food.</p><p>Before sunrise, the first call to prayer could be heard from the minaret. Life in the market square began to stir. In a land where people have little to share save their generosity, a woman cooking a traditional breakfast of millet porridge offered him a sample. 'My morning pick-me-up,' he said. Having gone without sleep, he faced a full-day schedule of shooting.</p><p>The otherworldly shots he got that night are among the most spectacular in his stunning six-minute time-lapse movie titled Terra Sacra Time Lapses. The non-narrative film, taking for its title the Latin for 'sacred earth,' had its world premiere at the Imax Theatre in Victoria 10 days ago. (The film has since been posted on Vimeo and YouTube.) The audience so enjoyed it, they demanded an immediate second screening.</p><p>The high-definition images were captured in 24 nations on all seven continents over a six-year period, as Mr. White worked for the television programs Ancient Megastructures, Battle Castle and Travels to the Edge with Art Wolfe. The time-lapse stills include images of King penguins at Fortuna Bay on South Georgia Island; tourists at Al Khazneh (The Treasury) at Petra, Jordan; and crawling worshippers circumambulating the Boudhanath Stupa at Kathmandu.</p><p>He also shot Mount Fuji in Japan, the Diamond Gorge in Australia and the spiny forest of Madagascar.</p><p>With a rousing soundtrack by B.C. composer Roy Milner, the result is a breathtaking tour of natural and man-made wonders.</p><p>Mr. White, 34, recently moved to Tofino with his wife, Deddeda, a photographer and Globe and Mail contributor. Mr. White only took up photography after high school, when he snapped images of a mountain-climbing expedition with friends in Nepal. He then enrolled at the Western Academy of Photography in his Victoria hometown, where he was inspired to become a photojournalist after a one-day session with Ted Grant, the legendary lensman. Mr. White's career with daily newspapers did not last long, as he was soon shooting for such prestigious publications as National Geographic Adventure. He also created award-winning adventure films such as Beyond Gravity, about mountain climbers, and Into the Thunder Dragon, about a pair of mountain unicyclists.</p><p>The photographer has released Sacra Terra Time Lapses as a noncommercial film, a celebration of the planet.</p><p>Why did he decide to go with a time-lapse technique?</p><p>'It's a distortion of reality,' he said. 'You see time passing. It's a dream-like view. You don't see things pass like that in real life. It's a different way of looking at the world.'</p><p>Not all shoots went as planned. At Angkor Wat, a Cambodian assistant was told to guard the camera. Alas, he was not told the camera had a wide-angle lens and was shooting the passage of time. At the end of the day when Mr. White looked at the images shot in his absence, he saw the assistant step into the frame, sit on steps, and push a hat over his eyes for a nap.</p><p>'To get the good stuff,' Mr. White said, 'you have to make all the mistakes.'</p><p>Special to The Globe and Mail</p>, <p>' Our government has made a commitment to support open government and this act provides another tangible example of following through on that commitment,' said John Les, after introducing a bill that provides for election of B.C.'s representatives in the Senate.</p><p>Senator Gerry St. Germain turns 75 on Nov. 6, hitting the age of compulsory retirement after close to 20 years in the Red Chamber. That will open up a Senate posting that could be filled with an election under legislation introduced in the B.C. Legislature earlier this week by backbencher John Les.</p><p>Mr. Les, the MLA for Chilliwack, is optimistic that the Senate Election Act will be passed into law within three months and an election to replace Mr. St. Germain will be held before the end of the year. Without constitutional change in Ottawa, the final decision on whether the candidate elected by B.C. moves into Mr. St. Germain's seat would remain with the federal cabinet. The successful candidate would be B.C.'s recommendation to the federal cabinet on who should be appointed.</p><p>Mr. Les says the bill, which has the support of Premier Christy Clark, reflects a consensus of opinion based on discussions with government staff and caucus members. 'People always prefer a democratic transparent election process versus a backroom appointee type process,' he said in an interview. 'Everyone recognizes there are further improvements needed to the Senate. Let's just say this is perhaps a first step in an incremental process.'</p><p>But will it open up government?</p><p>The proposed legislation provides for the province to be divided into six districts - Vancouver Island, Southern Interior, Northern British Columbia, South of the Fraser, North of the Fraser and Vancouver. However, Senate elections will not be held across the province once the bill is approved. The only election would be to chose a candidate to replace Mr. St. Germain.</p><p>Mr. Les anticipates that Vancouver Island, the only area of the province that is not now associated with one of the province's senators, would vote for Mr. St Germain's successor. Among the current roster of senators, Larry Campbell, Mobina Jaffer and Yonah Martin are from the Lower Mainland, Richard Neufeld is from the North and Nancy Greene Raine is from the Thompson-Okanagan-Kootenay area. If the five senators keep their seats, the earliest date for another Senate election would be 2018, when Ms. Greene Raine would be forced to retire.</p><p>A provision in the bill requiring online voting has also attracted some criticism. Political scientist Dennis Pilon, of York University, said the current state of online voting is 'a horror show.' Experts have raised concerns about the security of voting, saying the process could not be made tamper-proof from hackers. Also, secrecy may be harder to enforce, allowing for undue influence by family members or others.</p><p>Bruce Hallsor, who co-chaired the group advocating electoral reform in the B.C. referendum on proportional representation, raised concerns about giving more credibility to the Senate while B.C. does not have its appropriate share of seats in the institution. 'At least when it is not legitimate, it does not matter that we are not fairly represented. If more provinces do this [elect senators] I think it is a recipe for disaster.'</p><p>Mr. Les anticipated that issue, including a provision in the bill to kill the law after eight years. 'This really is serving notice on the federal government. We're electing senators, but you have to rectify the imbalance,' he said.</p><p>But putting a time-limit on the right to vote sounds like something less than a commitment to open government. At any rate, backbenchers rarely spearhead the process of making new laws. It seems more likely a provincial cabinet minister - rather than a backbencher - would have introduced the legislation if Senate reform was really 'another tangible example' of a government commitment.</p>, <p>Until recently, it looked like Ontario's first minority government since the 1980s would get through at least a year before the inevitable election speculation ramped up.</p><p>Then it became clear how much Dalton McGuinty is prepared to test opposition parties with austerity measures such as the ones announced Sunday - a slowing of planned increases to the Ontario Child Benefit and a freeze of social-assistance rates.</p><p>Given the urgency of tackling a $16-billion deficit before it leads to a debt crisis, it's a relief that Tuesday's budget won't just see the government in a holding pattern, preoccupied by its own survival. But the defeat of that budget would only give markets and credit raters further reason to worry about the state of the province's finances.</p><p>And while it's still a remote possibility, it's no longer unimaginable that Mr. McGuinty has overplayed his hand.</p><p>Both the Liberals and Tim Hudak's Progressive Conservatives, who have made a show of opposing virtually every government policy but are nowhere near election-ready, have been counting on the third-party NDP to back the budget. But in recent weeks, as the Liberals have signalled a sharp shift toward leaner government, New Democrats have begun sending signals that their support shouldn't be taken for granted.</p><p>Decisions such as the ones unveiled by the Premier on Sunday are part of the equation. While somewhat offset by efforts to spread the pain, likely including a cancellation of further corporate tax cuts, there are only so many affronts to NDP values that can be crammed into the budget before Andrea Horwath's party feels compelled to vote against it.</p><p>Meanwhile, aggressive moves on wage costs may cause New Democrats to see political opportunity. Mr. McGuinty has eaten their lunch by forging a close relationship with organized labour; the chance to finally reclaim some of that support could be too much to pass up.</p><p>Perhaps the biggest risk of post-budget volatility comes from policy decisions that disproportionately affect certain opposition-held ridings. How, for instance, will northern members - who make up a significant chunk of the NDP caucus - support a budget that includes a shut-down of the Ontario Northland Transportation Commission?</p><p>With the looming cancellations of hospital and other infrastructure projects, there will be more regional flare-ups. If enough of them add up, caucus hawkishness could become a stronger force than strategic considerations - and not just in the NDP.</p><p>Absent New Democratic support or abstention, the next best hope for the budget's passage would be Mr. Hudak telling a couple of his MPPs to call in sick when it comes time to vote. But an over-the-top reaction to the cancellation of supports for the provincial horse-racing industry has already shown that Mr. Hudak has tenuous control over his largely rural caucus, and that's before MPPs find out what other cuts land in their backyards.</p><p>For all that, both opposition parties know Mr. McGuinty's willingness to test them is born partly of awareness that his Liberals are the closest to being election-ready. The Tories have yet to craft a policy agenda, or even name a new campaign team, and it's unclear how conservatives would campaign against austerity. While slightly more stable, the NDP hasn't had time to fix the sub-par ground game that limited its gains last fall.</p><p>So the odds remain that cooler heads will prevail. But a province already in the grips of economic and fiscal upheaval is about to face at least a glimpse of political turmoil on top of it.</p>, <p>Listening to Andy Byford talk is like feeling the blast of air that hits you when a subway train comes into the station. Whoosh. Change is coming to the TTC. It's about time.</p><p>Since taking over from the sacked Gary Webster as chief executive of the Toronto Transit Commission in March, Mr. Byford has emerged as the most impressive public official in the city today - ambitious, articulate, frank and determined to bring change to the stodgy organization. On a visit to The Globe and Mail's editorial board on Monday, he bubbled over with plans for the transit system that Torontonians depend on but love to complain about.</p><p>His aim, he said, is to 'transform the TTC from top to bottom.' The way he sees it, nothing less will do. The transit system, while sound in many ways, is 'in desperate need of modernization,' viewed by many of its users as arrogant, inefficient and bureaucratic.</p><p>Too true. When he took over, the TTC had just been through what he calls an 'annus horribilis.' Reports of dozing ticket takers and texting drivers brought to the surface the anger that many riders were feeling about the TTC's often indifferent service.</p><p>Things have started looking up a little since. New subway cars have arrived on the Yonge line. New streetcars are on their way. A deal has been reached to bring in Presto payment cards for easier service. As a symbol of change, Mr. Byford has even done away with the antiquated overhead projector for management meetings. It's all PowerPoint now.</p><p>But changing the TTC will require more than new equipment and vehicles, says Mr. Byford, a veteran of transit systems in London, England, and Sydney, Australia. It will require a vast cultural change. TTC employees have to start treating people as customers rather than just cargo. TTC managers have to start treating employees as people.</p><p>'We will have failed and we won't have met that challenge of transformation and particularly transforming our reputation with customers and stakeholders if it doesn't feel different to you as riders and customers,' he says. 'What I don't want is at the end of five years for customers to say 'Yeah, fair enough, we've got shiny new vehicles, but the service is the same old surly service that we've always suffered.''</p><p>To give riders at least a taste of the changes to come, Mr. Byford has refurbished rundown subway washrooms, stepped up subway-car cleaning and improved announcements about service disruptions. He insists that when streetcars make a short turn and force everyone off to wait for the next one, the drivers at least tell riders why.</p><p>He and his executive team have been taking some of their meetings on the road, away from the bunker-like TTC headquarters at Yonge and Davisville. He himself often rides the system to greet employees and sometimes spends a day doing one of their jobs to see what it's like. 'What we have to do first of all is change how we manage,' he says.</p><p>To that end, he has put out a new mission statement ('A transit system that makes Toronto proud'), introduced a daily customer-service report and drawn up 25 key performance indicators to keep score on everything from customer satisfaction to financial performance.</p><p>All of this change will be devilishly hard for an organization as big and as conservative as the TTC. 'I think the next four years are going to be quite the rollercoaster ride. I'm going to be a busy man,' Mr. Byford says.</p><p>To add to the challenge, the TTC is in a financial fix. The city has frozen its subsidy, the province is tapped out and Mr. Byford doesn't feel he can ask for a big fare hike until he starts to deliver on some of his promises. The TTC is requesting only a five-cent increase for next year.</p><p>Despite all this, he says he is confident that with its many, often-overlooked advantages - a 'fantastic' work force, a comprehensive network that is the envy of many cities - the TTC can bounce back with a dose of new energy and leadership. He seems just the one to deliver it.</p>, <p>I wasn't planning on having the 'cop talk' with my two older kids just yet. I thought I'd wait until they were at least 12 or 13. You, know, when they could better understand why the people who swear to uphold the law and protect citizens sometimes do stupid and illegal things.</p><p>But the issue came up during the Lunar New Year Parade in Chinatown. As the crowds swirled around us, I asked a question I knew they would know the answer to.</p><p>'If we get separated or lost, what do you do?'</p><p>'Find a police officer,' they repeated dutifully. 'You can trust them.'</p><p>We've been over it a million times.</p><p>Thankfully, the conversation ended there. But they're smart kids (I know, every parent says that) who read the papers and listen to news on the radio. I wonder how much longer I can expect them to believe me.</p><p>In my imagined scenario, we are in the car, where all of the best conversations happen.</p><p>A police cruiser passes us on the left, slows for a red light, flashes its lights and moves on.</p><p>'That cop just drove through a red light!'</p><p>'They're allowed to do that. They must be on their way to an emergency.'</p><p>At the next intersection, we pull up beside the cruiser, which is no longer in a hurry.</p><p>'Why aren't they going through this red light?'</p><p>'I don't know, maybe it's not an emergency any more.'</p><p>'Well what about that police officer in Kelowna who parked in the disabled parking space? You always get mad at people who do that if they don't have the special sticker.'</p><p>'She was going to arrest a shoplifter at a mall.'</p><p>'Was that an emergency?'</p><p>'Well, no. It wasn't. She's been given a good talking to. And she has to pay a parking ticket. Police get in trouble too, you know,' I tell them.</p><p>'You mean like the 14 police officers in Vancouver who got in trouble for sending around dirty e-mails?'</p><p>'Yeah, like them.'</p><p>'Are they going to get a good talking to as well?'</p><p>'I imagine so.'</p><p>'Can their bosses fire them?'</p><p>'Yes, they can, but the officer would have to do something really, really bad. Sometimes the bosses get in trouble too.'</p><p>'Yeah, like the police chief in Victoria who left his loaded gun under his car seat.'</p><p>'Well, to be fair, the car was locked and it was parked in the police garage, which should mean it's safe.'</p><p>'Yeah, but that's just dumb.'</p><p>'Well, he left it there because he had to go talk to the media about some weapons that had gone missing from his police station. People do all kinds of things in police cars.'</p><p>'Oh.'</p><p>'When you guys were really little, he was the chief of police in Vancouver, you know.'</p><p>'Did he leave his gun in his car then too?'</p><p>'No, but he did leave a target from the shooting range on the city manager's desk.'</p><p>'What's a city manager?'</p><p>'She's the boss of the city.'</p><p>'Why did he leave it on her desk?'</p><p>'I don't know. I guess maybe he was proud of it, like when you guys do well on a test, you want everybody to see it. He wrote her a note telling her how much more he liked shooting his gun than being at work.'</p><p>'That's creepy.'</p><p>'The city manager thought so too. Hey, do you guys know what 'discreditable conduct' means?'</p><p>'No, what is it?'</p><p>'Never mind, just something else.'</p><p>'Does it mean zapping somebody with a taser?'</p><p>'No, but police do that sometimes too.'</p><p>'Yeah, like if you don't pay your fare on the SkyTrain.'</p><p>'Or like the guy at Vancouver airport who didn't speak English.'</p><p>'Yes, like him. His name was Robert.'</p><p>'But he died.'</p><p>'Yes he did.'</p><p>'Did the police get in trouble for that?'</p><p>'Sort of. They all have to go to court.'</p><p>'Are they still police officers?'</p><p>'Yes, they are.'</p><p>Stephen Quinn is the host of On the Coast on CBC Radio One, 690 AM and 88.1 FM in Vancouver. stephen.quinn@cbc.ca</p>, <p>Somewhere at sea tonight, an hour before midnight, Adam Kreek and Richard Tarbill will roll out of their narrow bunks, their balance now perfectly tuned to the pitch of the sea, and make their way out on deck.</p><p>They won't have far to go, because they are living in a rowboat.</p><p>Outside they will relieve Greg Spooner and Jordan Hanssen, or Markus Pukonen, an alternate rower. After four hours bending their backs to keep the eight-metre ocean boat moving on its 1,200-kilometre circumnavigation of Vancouver Island, the pair at the oars will be glad of the shift change.</p><p>The five friends, whose nautical adventure is being sponsored by the Canadian Wildlife Federation, are rowing around the island to help raise public awareness about ocean conservation.</p><p>'The real purpose is to inspire other people to get outside, to have their own adventures,' Mr. Kreek said on the phone from Port Hardy, on the north end of Vancouver Island, where the boat had been compelled to stop by gale-force winds.</p><p>'The ocean environment on the West Coast is fragile. And it is beautiful. The key message I have is: Explore it if you want to protect it. Get out there. Be smart, be safe, do it with friends, and spend some time really getting to know the ocean,' said Mr. Kreek, an Olympic rower who won a gold medal for Canada in Beijing.</p><p>Midway through their journey, which began in Vancouver harbour on April 11 and is due to end there on the 29th or 30th, the young men have come to love the ocean and its unpredictable moods.</p><p>'You feel alive out there. You are in such a wild environment. Not a lot of people get to experience that at such an intimate level,' Mr. Kreek said.</p><p>One of things he does as he rows and rows is to study the water. 'Watching the waves is great,' he said. 'The sea is changing all the time and is almost as if you are watching fire. ... then there is a little bit of pattern and you say, 'okay, there's a big wave going to come' ... and you brace for it ... and you rock and roll and go side to side.'</p><p>He laughs as he tells that story, and again as he describes how a huge, bull sea lion threatened them when it thought the boat was too close to his harem. He talks with an evident joy about watching phosphorescence swirl around the oar tips like the Northern Lights, of holding up his cellphone to match a star finder app with the heavens above, and of seeing sea otters play in the surf.</p><p>There have been some bad moments, such as when the rough seas made people sick or when endless sheets of rain fell (one downpour lasted 24 hours), but they have never felt like their lives were at risk.</p><p>'One of the biggest dangers out there are the large tankers and the vessels that could run over us ... but we are pretty vigilant,' he said. 'And we've been able to ride out most of the bad weather. Coming in to Port Hardy we had 25-knot winds with stronger gusts ... we were riding eight-foot waves coming in. Big waves. Strong weather. But I've been really impressed with the boat. We are almost like a little cork in the ocean. We just kind of keep edging forward.'</p><p>The first leg of the journey went through the relatively sheltered waters between Vancouver Island and the British Columbia mainland.</p><p>Mr. Kreek was interviewed just before heading around the exposed northern tip of the island, to start the homeward leg down the west coast of Vancouver Island, which is known as the Graveyard of the Pacific because of its history of wrecks. 'The most hairy part will be Cape Scott because we have to deal with very big winds coming off Queen Charlotte Strait and the Pacific Ocean,' he said. 'We're alone out there....That's why we've taken so long to plan. You don't want to be one of those people who haven't planned properly and who have to put up help signals.'</p><p>Mr. Kreek said the first four days of the trip were the hardest. Then the crew got into the routine.</p><p>'It's a very regimented daily schedule so it becomes very rhythmical, meditative, reflective and comfortable,' he said. 'And we are getting along really well. The rule is, if something's bothering you, get it out on the table.'</p><p>Mr. Kreek said the five were good friends before the journey. But now they have a stronger bond. And they are planning their next big adventure: In December, they will row across the Atlantic, crossing from West Africa to South America.</p><p>More information on the current journey, including up-to-date Web postings, can be found atOARNorthwest.com.</p>, <p>As it seeks to streamline regulations in order to expedite oil-development projects, the federal government appears willing to effectively defer to Alberta on matters of environmental protection. It is to the credit of that province's government that it is not viewing this leeway as a free pass, and instead is at least considering setting a climate-change strategy more ambitious than the one Ottawa would settle for - including higher carbon emission-reduction targets, and stiffer penalties for companies that fail to meet them.</p><p>For Alberta, such willingness should be considered a matter of enlightened self-interest. To simply move full-throttle toward oil-sands development, without adequate checks in place, would be to risk squandering the industry's long-term potential.</p><p>In order to fully capitalize on demand for its oil, Alberta needs to convince the United States and other international markets that it takes mounting environmental concerns seriously. Much the same can be said about selling more of Alberta's oil domestically, and securing the co-operation of other provinces - most notably British Columbia - in exporting it.</p><p>For now, all this still adds up only to a nascent effort with an uncertain outcome. Provincial bureaucrats are said to be preparing various proposals, including emissions-reductions targets as high as 20 or 30 per cent, but those ideas have not yet gone to Environment Minister Diana McQueen - let alone received sign-off from Premier Alison Redford and her cabinet, or been subjected to public scrutiny.</p><p>In the past, attempts by the province to bolster its regulatory regime have proven fleeting in the face of industry pressure; moving forward as aggressively as Ms. Redford's Progressive Conservatives are considering doing would require them to have very strong stomachs.</p><p>Still, there is something remarkable about members of Alberta's government complaining about the federal carbon strategy being too lax, as was reported this week. If that speaks to Ottawa's relative passivity on the file, it also suggests that Alberta is increasingly coming to see economic and environmental interests as interrelated rather than in conflict with each other. Who better to show leadership in striking the right balance than the province that could suffer most if we fail to do so?</p>, <p>This week, my government outlined five bottom-line requirements that must be met for British Columbia to consider support of any heavy oil pipeline project, including Enbridge's Northern Gateway. We know that Alberta's oil sands are an important resource and getting them to new markets represents a great economic opportunity for that province and our country. But as a premier, I am focused first and foremost on what's best for my province, and Northern Gateway currently contains far too great an imbalance of risks over benefits for B.C.</p><p>British Columbia's five bottom lines are as follows:</p><p>1. Successful completion of an environmental review process. In Enbridge's case, this means a recommendation by the Joint Review Panel that the project proceed.</p><p>2. World-leading marine oil-spill prevention and response systems to protect our coastlines and ocean. With the Enbridge project, British Columbia is taking 100 per cent of the marine risk. We need to make sure we improve our response and resource capacity. That means the federal government and industry are at the table and prepared to step up their support.</p><p>3. Enhancement of our on-land spill response to world-leading standards. We have looked at different models in different jurisdictions that include an industry- or polluter-pay principle to help offset any costs borne by the taxpayer in case of a spill. Again, this is important in the Enbridge context because nearly 60 per cent of the 1,172-kilometre pipeline would run through B.C.</p><p>4. Legal requirements regarding aboriginal and treaty rights must be addressed and first nations must be provided with opportunities to benefit from these projects. In B.C., we have led the way in working with first nations to ensure new developments are a win for communities, industry and the province.</p><p>5. B.C. must receive its fair share of the fiscal and economic benefits of the Enbridge project and other proposals for heavy oil pipelines.</p><p>Each of these requirements must be met; our need for environmental protection and safety is as important as aboriginal engagement as is our fair share of the fiscal and economic benefits of the Enbridge project.</p><p>Let's be clear, heavy oil is unlike any other commodity we transport across Canada. The inherent risks are not the same as in moving copper, gold, lumber or grain, for instance. If a train carrying wheat from Saskatchewan derails as it's moving to a B.C. port for shipment to Asia, the fiscal and environmental costs are manageable in relation to the benefits we receive. The risks are greatly offset by the number of jobs at our ports, tanker terminals and shipping yards.</p><p>The same cannot be said with shipping heavy oil across difficult terrain and shipping through challenging marine environments, such as the Douglas Channel. I have a duty to represent the interests of my province, its people, our values and our natural resources, and my government has been fair and reasonable, with strong and principled requirements.</p><p>I understand that for Alberta, the balance of risks and benefits are much different. Based on the Wright Mansell report Enbridge submitted to the environmental review process, of the $81-billion in incremental income the project is expected to generate over a 30-year period, nearly 40 per cent - $32-billion - will go to Alberta. Whereas British Columbia, despite shouldering 100 per cent of the marine oil-spill risk and a majority of the land oil-spill risk, will receives a much smaller benefit, roughly 8 per cent of the incremental income. The calculation for me as Premier is that there is too much unquantified risk with too little known benefit.</p><p>The B.C. government will maintain its active position as intervenors in the Joint Review Panel; next week, we will be submitting notice of our intent to cross-examine Enbridge. Those hearings begin in the fall and we will be asking Enbridge some tough questions throughout that process. But heavy oil is not the only energy commodity our government is focused on.</p><p>In fact, my government is working to develop a key energy resource and getting it to market: liquefied natural gas. Northeastern B.C. has massive reserves, and we have massive investments with thousands of potential jobs for British Columbians and revenues for the provincial government, with minimal risk to coasts or land, and the support of our first nations. Natural gas development and export is B.C.'s energy priority.</p><p>That is why I was so disappointed with the discussions at the Council of Federation in Halifax this week. Canada is a big country and each province has different interests, challenges and resources. We need to work together to leverage our strengths and expand and diversify our markets, but we cannot do so at the expense of each other's interests. We must work in concert. That is why I couldn't support a national energy strategy that does not address the concerns I have, that British Columbians have, about the movement of heavy oil across our province and coastlines.</p><p>British Columbians are fair and reasonable; we support development and environmental protection - but not at any cost.</p>, <p>The Toronto Zoo, which this week announced it would be allowing orangutans to use iPads, has relented to pressure and will be offering the trendy Apple tablets to other zoo animals. At a press conference yesterday morning, where zoo officials were greeted to jeers of 'the primate one per cent!' and 'anthrocentric scum,' the zoo confirmed that all members of the kingdom Animalia will be eligible.</p><p>'It's funny how the animals that look most like the zookeepers always get the best stuff,' said Andy, a giant Pacific octopus who claims he can use four iPads at once and whose first book,What's So Great about Great Apes? will be available for download on iBooks next week.</p><p>But not all zoo animals are critical of the policy. Twiga, a Masai giraffe who zoo officials hope may again be pregnant, said, 'We can't all be the first ones to get an iPad. I think the problem was communication. But what do you expect from a top-heavy publicly funded bureaucracy?'</p><p>One of the first things Twiga did with her new iPad was take HD video of two adolescent males 'necking,' or neck wrestling. 'This kind of behaviour is so dangerous that males have actually evolved a re-enforcing bone on top of their heads,' Twiga explained. 'But does that stop them?'</p><p>Once the wrestling match had concluded, Twiga showed her movie to the two males. 'It was just really embarrassing,' said Teeko, a five-year-old male who is also her son. 'I never realized how stupid it looked.'</p><p>Teeko and the other young males are now exploring alternate means of competing for potential mates - with their iPads. 'We all downloaded iDJ Live,' said Teeko, 'and now it's all about who can lay down the sickest beats.'</p><p>But even in the orderly confines of Canada's largest zoo, content is quickly becoming something of an untamed wilderness. Zoo animals, it turns out, also disagree on what makes for suitable content and what does not. Yesterday afternoon, an impala registered a formal complaint when he received an e-mail from an African lion containing a YouTube link of wildebeests getting massacred by Nile crocodiles during their migration across the Mara River.</p><p>Soon after, an young male olive baboon was discovered by his mother, Polly, using a bonobo app called 'There's a Sexual Position for That.' A representative from the company that created the app sent a statement stating, 'Bonobos are the only wild primate to use sexual play as a means of conflict resolution and stress reduction. This app takes that unique and positive behaviour to a different medium, that of the tablet.'</p><p>Polly, who happens to be the troop's alpha female, was unimpressed. 'They can call it what they like,' she raged in a post on Twitter. 'I call it filth.'</p><p>The latest e-controversy to hit the Rouge Valley? Platform wars. Nearly the entire Indomalaya pavilion is in a state of uproar over the choice of iPads. 'What about BlackBerry?' a fuming lion-tailed macaque asked on Vimeo. 'PlayBook 2.0 is a game changer. The unified In Box is revolutionary, and it's the only tablet with true multitasking.'</p><p>He was attacked - in cyberspace - by a golden lion tamarin, who posted a 9,000-word pro-Android manifesto on Google+.</p><p>By midnight, what had begun as a flame war had devolved into a real war, when the various OS factions - Apple, BlackBerry, Google - circled one another in the parking lot, gnashing teeth, puffing up breasts and spraying scent.</p><p>Everyone, that is, but the orangutans, who were crowded together and stooped over in laughter. Eventually, a female orangutan stepped into the fray holding an iPad above her head and announced, 'Hurling feces? It turns out there's an app for that.'</p><p>She then swiped the screen, which displayed a burst of animated video, and the entire zoo broke out in laughter.</p><p>Special to The Globe and Mail</p>, <p>Any Muslim worth his or her salt will feel a sense of justice over the guilty verdict handed down this week in the Shafia murder trial in Kingston. A father, a mother and a brother callously eliminated four of their own clan to protect the family's 'honour.' That in itself deserves the harshest of penalties the Canadian legal system can prescribe.</p><p>But any Muslim worth his or her salt will also need to do some serious soul-searching. For years, Muslim communities - in Canada, the U.K. and the U.S. - have approached honour crimes as something alien to Islam. They point out the obvious: Killing in the name of honour has nothing to do with their faith. And they are right, of course. They have also pointed out that many non-Muslim societies around the world tacitly condone the victimization of women to protect a man's honour. This, they have implied, clears Muslims of responsibility for dealing with misogynist behaviour in their community.</p><p>Others have argued that all cultures are infected by misogyny, thrusting honour killings into the same domain as domestic violence. In a 2010 Globe commentary, Gerald Caplan pointed out that 'terrible things still happen to women everywhere, as the domestic violence figures for Canada demonstrate. No nation, religion, class or ethnic group has the monopoly on misogyny.'</p><p>But they are mistaken. The vast majority of domestic violence against women in Canada are acts of impassioned violence. They happen in the moment, in states of rage. Let me be absolutely clear here: This should not provide a defence against those crimes. But it does place them in another category, one that our legal system covers: manslaughter.</p><p>In our society, the murderer who meticulously plans and calculates his killing occupies one of two categories: the hit man or the psychopath. The hit man kills for money, the psychopath for the thrill of it, or for some deep-seated hatred of the objects of his murderous wrath. In the cases of honour killings that Canada has seen, there are frightening similarities between how the killers acted and psychopathic behaviour.</p><p>In the Shafia case: Hamed Shafia, the 21-year old son of his co-accused mother, Tooba Yahya, and father, Mohammad, scouted out bodies of water days in advance of the murder, places where, presumably, the soon to be killed bodies of his stepmother and sisters could be disposed of. That is chillingly cold, remorselessly calculated.</p><p>And another case: the gruesome murder of five-year-old Farah Khan in 2000, killed by her father, Muhammad Arsal Khan, because he suspected she was not his biological daughter. Her murder was planned before she even arrived in Canada. Muhammad Khan, now serving life in prison, is alleged to have bought surgical instruments in his native Pakistan that were then used to dismember Farah's tiny body prior to disposing of it, in different locations, along Toronto's waterfront.</p><p>Acts like these are the acts of psychopaths, not of enraged husbands or fathers, and this is the distinction that must be made. Yet, men like Hamed Shafia and Muhammad Khan are not psychopaths. What to us appears to be psychopathic behaviour is accepted, and often encouraged, in their homelands.</p><p>I was in southern Pakistan this past summer, in the province of Sindh, which is considered the honour-killing capital of the world. I was there to follow up on an honour crime case I'd written about in 2006. I'd hoped to find some progress in Pakistan's struggle against the culture of ownership of women - their treatment as property - that leaves hundreds, potentially thousands, dead every year. What I found instead was that nothing had changed. It had, in fact, gotten worse.</p><p>The Pakistani community in Canada, the Afghan community also, and Muslims in general, must face up to the fact that this sort of thing is happening in their homelands, and it's not getting any better. And as more and more people emigrate to Canada, from places where killing a woman for honour is as simple as taking out the garbage, it is up to them, the communities themselves, to ensure that new arrivals are made aware of the monstrous errors they are making.</p><p>That since 2002, 12 people have died in Canada as a result of honour - the majority of them Muslims - is unacceptable. Less known is the fact that an untold number of young Muslim girls face the kind of oppressive domestic lives the Shafia girls were forced to endure, living in a state of fear, forced to be something they are not.</p><p>These are the quiet tragedies playing out every day in the community. Canadian Muslims should bow their heads in shame, not because honour killing has anything to do with Islam, but because they have failed to protect women under threat, and to educate Muslims who arrive here carrying traditions with them that are not only an affront to Canadian values, but damage the honour of Islam itself.</p><p>Adnan Khan is a writer and commentator based in Kabul.</p>, <p>Ronald Smith, originally of Red Deer, Alta., committed two monstrous murders in Montana in 1982, when he was in his mid-20s, and asked for the death penalty. But the death penalty itself is monstrous, and 30 years later, the State of Montana should grant clemency to Mr. Smith not because he has changed, as he claims, but because the world has.</p><p>Capital punishment is gone from nearly all other Western democracies, and so the spectacle on display at the Montana Board of Pardons and Parole this week would have been unthinkable almost anywhere else in the West. One by one, family members of the murdered ones, denied closure for decades, advocated publicly for the death of the convicted killer, while on the other side the daughter of that killer, having spent her entire life in the shadow of that death penalty, begged for her father's life to be spared.</p><p>This was degrading to Montana, not to the individuals involved; it degraded the justice system that invited them to put their pain and emotion at the service of a state with the power to kill, or in opposition to that power. To conscript suffering people into a decades-long fight over life and death is heartlessly cruel.</p><p>Montana, which has a low murder rate and is not a big death-penalty state, should look at the example set last week by Connecticut, the fifth state in five years to repeal the death penalty. Seventeen states are now abolitionist. The endless appeals are costly, the deterrent value is minimal, and the punishment consistently falls more harshly on blacks and the poor.</p><p>Capital punishment is recognized as wrong almost throughout the Western world because the state should support life's sanctity; fighting murder by putting a human being to death in cold blood diminishes the sanctity of life. It is a violent society's answer to violence. It adds to the sum of violence in that society.</p><p>'I've destroyed so many lives,' Mr. Smith told the CBC. 'Not only the victims' lives but the families of the victims and my family and my own life.' Clemency for Mr. Smith would end the cycle of destruction - a cycle that government should have no part in.</p>, <p>In March, Canada closed its embassy in Syria. Earlier this month, Canada closed its embassy in Iran. Now we learn that sharing embassies with Britain may benefit Ottawa's bottom line. In some of these cases, there were important diplomatic and security reasons for scaling down formal ties. But even without diplomats on the ground, Canada's relationships don't need to suffer. How do we protect ties in countries where we have no physical presence? The next best thing is a virtual embassy. And virtual embassies should be the anchor to Foreign Affairs' strategy in the area of digital diplomacy.</p><p>Embassies perform a crucial role in maintaining diplomatic ties with foreign governments, but their function is to maintain economic, political and cultural engagement with people in distant lands. There have been a few experiments with virtual embassies - the United States has one for Iran. But some have critiqued these early ventures as being largely about propaganda: links to press releases and pages about constitutional history do not make for lively cross-cultural engagement. Such basic websites don't support real interaction, which is crucial for letting political attaches in Canada's Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade keep their fingers on the pulse of the communities they are responsible for. Indeed, the work of diplomacy does not just involve talking, it involves listening.</p><p>Ideally, sane and stable governments have good conversations with each other. But in countries where diplomatic relations between governments have completely broken down, Canada's diplomats can still support civil-society groups that do good work. In less than ideal settings, Canadian diplomats should be involved in dialogue with political actors other than recalcitrant dictators.</p><p>Practically speaking, what digital tools, other than a website, should we use to equip Canada's foreign service officers? Our virtual embassy could offer online training in Internet security to help democracy advocates become more tech-savvy. Such an embassy could provide links to the surveillance circumvention tools being built. It could host a two-way social-media dialogue with non-combatant activists in Syria and Iran. It could provide - in Arabic and Farsi - information on Canada's political positions on global affairs and how to get visas, how to apply for refugee status, how to take advantage of Canadian educational opportunities. A virtual embassy needs to be more than a storehouse for propaganda; it needs fresh content and responsive, full-time staff. Some consular matters could still be handled through another country that does have a physical presence. But more than content, Canada's diplomats need permission to engage with foreign publics over social media without having each tweet edited by the minister.</p><p>Working digitally would not necessarily undermine the use of the other tools in the diplomatic toolkit. Indeed, modern diplomats increasingly find that their work involves both digital and face-to-face communication. In recent years, even the political officers of Canadian missions have found their local contacts migrating to Facebook. When we decide to break ties with a foreign government, we still have an obligation to engage with local democracy movements. If we pull out, we need to be ready to fill the vacuum with a virtual embassy to continue that engagement.</p><p>There certainly would be security concerns, as there are in the physical presence of any diplomatic mission. And as others have argued, the guidelines for clearing tweets can be similar, but not exactly the same, as the process for clearing other written communications. Ultimately, a designated ambassador should be responsible and should set the process and tone for communications. Tweets or other social media feeds shouldn't contradict Canadian policy and field staff should get clearance from Ottawa for messages on especially sensitive topics. Of course, diplomats' digital networks are ultimately their social networks, and these networks should not just serve the party in charge in Ottawa. Indeed, diplomatic relationships should outlast any particular Parliament.</p><p>This is not about dabbling in different communications tools. And Foreign Affairs should not build a social media strategy that is really only designed to guard against occasional mistakes or surveil its own diplomats. This is about building a large diplomatic corps with the tech savvy to conduct themselves responsibly over social media. It is also about projecting power: reaching vast networks of people our diplomats were not able to reach previously, and drawing strategic information from that network in the service of our foreign-policy interests. No tweeting recipes from the Canadian ambassador's kitchen. It is about building the organizational capacity to communicate, and listen, over social media. Canada's diplomatic officers need to be given the authority to respond and expand communications online. Most important, they need practice. Elsewhere, I've argued that we need more social media in international relations, not less, and that diplomats should climb the social media learning curve now, not a decade from now.</p><p>The Canadian government has closed its embassy in Iran, but we shouldn't end our relationship with the people of Iran. A virtual embassy would allow us to keep that interaction alive, and make visible what life is like in a country where freedom and faith coexist. A hundred years ago, only a country's senior diplomats and high level politicians were allowed to do diplomacy by telephone. Today, a growing number of people, including Syrians and Iranians, are on Facebook, YouTube and Twitter. Canada's diplomats need to meet them there.</p><p>Philip N.

Its careful balancing of interests explains why Canada has one of the world's oldest continuously operative constitutions. Returning to the wisdom of the founding fathers might help us navigate the current debate on oil pipelines.</p><p>As befits a federation, section 92(13) of the BNA Act gave the provinces legislative authority over 'property and civil rights in the province.' But realizing that provincial politicians would often be tempted to play beggar thy neighbour against other provinces, the founding fathers put balancing provisions in section 92(10). Subsection (a) gives the federal Parliament jurisdiction over railways, canals and 'other works and undertakings' (including pipelines in today's world) extending across provincial boundaries. British Columbia, or any other province, simply does not have constitutional jurisdiction to block a pipeline coming from another province if federal authorities approve it.</p><p>Even stronger is the so-called 'declaratory power' found in subsection (c). This allows Parliament to declare a work, even though 'wholly situate within the province,' to be for the general advantage of Canada, or of two or more provinces, and therefore to come under federal jurisdiction. Parliament could invoke the declaratory power over all the local roads, bridges, storage facilities, hydro connections and any other physical installations necessary to construct and maintain a pipeline.</p><p>Section 92(10) powers are an extremely important and often used part of the Canadian Constitution. In the first five decades of Canadian history, the declaratory power was invoked more than 400 times, mostly to ensure that Canada's burgeoning railway system grew to national advantage. By the First World War, virtually every inch of rail track in Canada was under federal jurisdiction. More recently, the declaratory power was used to make Canada's nuclear industry a federal matter.</p><p>It has become routine for provincial politicians to speak as if they had the power to block the construction of pipelines. They do not - at least not if Parliament chooses to exercise the powers given to it by the Constitution.</p><p>Prime Minister Stephen Harper has also said for more than 20 years that he believes in a strict construction of the Constitution, in which both the provinces and Ottawa should be free to exercise their jurisdiction without interference from the other level. That is, at least in part, why Ottawa is now transferring health-care money to the provinces without imposing new conditions - health care is a matter of provincial jurisdiction. However, the powers given the federal government by section 92(10) are just as much a part of the Constitution as are the powers given the provinces by the rest of section 92.</p><p>But Mr. Harper also wants Canada to become an 'energy superpower,' which may require connecting the constitutional dots. Canada will never become an energy superpower if some provinces prevent other provinces from exporting their petroleum products. Indeed, domestic production will decline, and we will become even more dependent on imported oil.</p><p>That is where we are headed if current trends continue, as environmentalists whip up hysterical opposition to all pipelines. They oppose not just new projects, like Enbridge's Northern Gateway, but the expansion of existing pipelines (Kinder Morgan's Trans Mountain line to Vancouver) and the reversal of existing ones in Ontario, allowing western crude to replace imported crude in eastern refineries. Politicians find the pressures irresistible at election time and climb on the anti-pipeline bandwagon, just as Premier Jean Charest has forbidden the production of shale gas in Quebec due to fear-mongering about the alleged dangers of fracking.</p><p>The collapse of Alberta Premier Alison Redford's well-meaning but naive 'national energy strategy' shows how weak the provinces are at promoting the national interest. Only the federal government can reverse the trend. Of course, negotiation would be better than imposition; but if negotiations fail, Parliament may have to perform the BNA Act in public.</p><p>Tom Flanagan is professor of political science at the University of Calgary and a campaign manager for conservative parties.</p>, <p>Guns pose an extraordinary danger, to the households of their owners and to the communities in which they proliferate. So a suburban New York daily, The Journal News, was acting in the public interest when it published a list of names and addresses of 33,000 handgun permit-holders in two counties, freely available from public sources. Even so, we feel uncomfortable with the invasion of privacy and potential for harm, and wonder whether the newspaper might have achieved most of its public-interest goals without outing individual permit-holders.</p><p>Some media critics, such as Al Tompkins of the Poynter Institute in Florida, say the newspaper would have served its readers better by offering more context, such as whether people with criminal records had obtained permits. But people are being killed or injured at an extraordinary rate because of guns, many of them obtained legally. The killing of 20 children and six adults at an elementary school in Connecticut last month is just one example. Twelve thousand homicides, 18,000 suicides, 600 killed and 14,000 wounded in accidents each year - how much more context is necessary?</p><p>The Journal sought to tell readers who has guns so they can know, for instance, whether it is safe to send their children to play at someone else's home. Yet not all permit-holders have guns at home; and owners of long guns do not need a permit. So people still do not know for sure who has a gun at home.</p><p>It is probably awkward to ask a neighbour or parent of your child's school chum about guns at home, but if you feel poor storage of guns is a danger, you probably shouldn't be satisfied with the information on the list.</p><p>There is a sense of a civilizational clash over guns building in the U.S. Those who abhor guns are fighting back. But three are potential dangers. Thieves could use the list to determine what homes can be robbed of guns, or what homes can be robbed without having to shoot a gun owner. A map without addresses and names probably would have made the point about the mad and threateningly close proliferation of weapons.</p>, <p>Alberta's Wildrose Party says it would implement a law to protect the 'conscience rights' of health professionals, apparently to include marriage commissioners, who would not have to solemnize marriages involving gay or lesbian couples.</p><p>It is unclear in what ways health professionals are being denied freedom of conscience at the moment. Are doctors being required to perform abortions against their will? If so, no public complaint has been made that we are aware of. Would doctors have the right to swear off treating patients of the opposite sex? Would family physicians be entitled to refuse to prescribe birth control pills, or could they insist, when faced with a teenage girl, on counselling abstinence only?</p><p>Party Leader Danielle Smith has explicitly mentioned 'conscience rights' for marriage commissioners, who perform civil ceremonies. Each commissioner would in effect be handed a licence to discriminate. Gay and lesbian marriage is the law of the land - but gays would have to go to the back of the bus and wait for someone willing to serve as driver, if Wildrose has its way. And nothing would prevent a marriage commissioner with a sincere religious belief from refusing to marry an interracial or interfaith couple.</p><p>A new human-rights court, replacing the Human Rights Commission, would settle disputes; but why create unnecessary work for judges with a law that gives false expectations? The Saskatchewan Court of Appeal was unanimous that marriage commissioners have no 'conscience rights,' as envisioned by Wildrose. The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms protects freedom of conscience and religion, but no freedom is absolute - and Alberta can't make it so.</p><p>Then there are the teachers - who surely have the same right to conscience rights as medical professionals and marriage commissioners. Why should they be forced to teach sex education, or evolution for that matter?</p><p>It is an illusory victory for conscience that Wildrose is promising. It would not 'put patients first,' as Ms. Smith has promised. It could put roadblocks in the way of young people seeking birth control. Imagine people with a special need in a small town, trooping around in search of a doctor or pharmacist willing to provide it - hardly the kind of Alberta most Albertans want.</p>, <p>A town crier delivered a proclamation and birthday cake was served last week to mark the 150th anniversary of the incorporation of the city of Victoria.</p><p>On this august occasion, citizens took to the streets and squares on the weekend to wish the City of Gardens many happy returns.</p><p>Two free anniversary celebrations held simultaneously on Saturday offered contrasting images of the city. One harkened to the past, the other to a dynamic present.</p><p>On the south lawn of Craigdarroch Castle, a mansion built from the riches extracted from Vancouver Island coal mines at the cost of many lives, celebrants dressed in period costume while playing croquet, sipping tea and enjoying the 14-piece Raven Baroque orchestra.</p><p>Less than two kilometres down the hill, in a grittier downtown setting, two blocks of Amelia Street were closed to vehicles for a block party celebrating local food, music and visual arts. Kathryn Calder and Acres of Lions performed, as did a troupe from Theatre SKAM, who dressed as conquistadors while engaging in a shootout with waterguns shaped like flintlock pistols.</p><p>A power-ballad singalong petered out, though a karaoke session featuring a live band was more successful.</p><p>Volunteers at the block party collected a suggested $5 donation with the proceeds going to the nearby Our Place, which provides food and rooms to the homeless. Amelia Street, which boasts rows of renovated heritage buildings, many of them home to businesses such as law offices, has also been known as a gathering place for crack addicts and others among the city's raggedy army of lost souls.</p><p>The Craigdarroch event mirrored much of the traditional boosterism of the city, the kind which can be found in glossy brochures.

His doctors considered him to be in a persistent vegetative state but acknowledged that he might be minimally conscious, aware of his circumstances, yet still incapable of expressing preferences. His wife acts as his substitute decision-maker, pursuing his best interests because he was never able to tell her what he would want.</p><p>The doctors anticipate no improvement in Mr. Rasouli's condition and, considering active treatment futile, proposed to remove his life support and administer palliative care for comfort until natural death occurs. But his wife disagreed, saying continued life support is in her husband's best interests.</p><p>The doctors claim that discontinuation of ineffective treatment does not require consent by or on behalf of a patient. They asked a court to confirm that withdrawing futile life support is a medical decision for them, not the patient, to make. The trial judge decided that, on the terms set out in Ontario's Health Care Consent Act, doctors' withdrawal of treatment from a patient is part of their 'plan of treatment' and that this can be implemented only with consent given by or on behalf of the patient.</p><p>The judge ruled that, if the doctors consider that the substitute decision-maker is not acting in the patient's best interests, as the act requires, they should refer the case to Ontario's Consent and Capacity Board. The board may uphold a decision it considers competently made by or on behalf of a patient, or substitute its own decision. The Ontario Court of Appeal upheld the trial result, paving the way for the doctors' final appeal to the Supreme Court.</p><p>The Supreme Court must decide on the basis of the Ontario legislation, but the doctors argue that this mainly codifies the background general law. As a national court, the Supreme Court is likely to reflect on how the case fits within the wider Canadian legal framework. Under the general law, patients may decide to accept or reject treatments offered according to their doctors' clinical judgment but can't insist on treatments that aren't so offered, usually because their doctors consider them inappropriate. Doctor-patient interactions are not acts of government, so claims are unlikely to arise of denials of rights under the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.</p><p>Mr. Rasouli's doctors fear that, if they require patients' consent to withdraw care that's proving of no benefit, refusal of consent may compel them to use scarce resources in worthless treatments. Worse, treatment devoted to patients it can't help would be denied to patients it would benefit. They also worry that, if initiated care can't be withdrawn as doctors judge appropriate, then care that might prove helpful might not be started. The Court of Appeal considered these fears groundless, since it was 'prepared to accept that the [Ontario] Act does not require doctors to obtain consent from a patient or substitute decision-maker to withhold or withdraw 'treatment' that they view as medically ineffective or inappropriate.'</p><p>But the Court of Appeal did rule that removing a patient from a ventilator and placing him on a program of palliative care until he dies is 'treatment.' Consent is accordingly required, from the patient, substitute decision-maker or the independent Consent and Capacity Board. The Supreme Court will address the competing autonomy of doctors and patients in medical care, and implications of replacement of historical medical paternalism ('doctor knows best') by patients' informed choices.</p><p>One issue not addressed was the possible impact of patient choices on health-care costs. With Canada's aging population and an accumulation of health-care costs in prolonged end-of-life care, patient autonomy may conflict with doctors' ability, and willingness, to act as gatekeepers of public health-care resources.</p><p>Doctors are required to use the means available to them to care for individual patients in the patients' best interests. Even when responsible for the care of several patients dependent on the same resources, they must give priority to the patient with whom they're immediately engaged. They can't sacrifice the interests of that patient to preserve resources that may benefit another patient. Equally, however, they can't indulge that patient with treatment they believe is futile or extravagant. Their fear of being required to accommodate the unrealistic hopes of patients or their families justifies more relief than the Court of Appeal offered.</p><p>The Supreme Court faces the challenge of providing comfort, to doctors and patients alike, that health-care resources will not legally have to be deployed with no realistic prospect of benefit. The alternative is trusting that provincial legislatures can resolve competing interests of doctors required to practise to professional standards, and patients wanting the care they believe will benefit them, with greater clarity than the legislation at the centre of this appeal achieved.</p><p>Bernard Dickens is professor emeritus of health law and policy at the University of Toronto.</p>, <p>The Northern Gateway pipeline that Enbridge proposes to build from Alberta's bitumen oil to the Pacific coast of British Columbia is, for all intents and purposes, dead.</p><p>Yes, regulatory hearings before the National Energy Board will continue until the NEB approves the project. And yes, Enbridge will keep pushing for it. And yes, the Harper government, which is so publicly committed to the project, will continue to extol its virtues as part of the need to get Canadian resources to Asia.</p><p>But the project is dead. It has too many obstacles now, and there'll be more in the future.</p><p>To survive, the Gateway pipeline would have to push past the growing opposition of British Columbians in general, the opposition of the current Liberal provincial government and the NDP government likely to replace it next year, the unanimous opposition of environmentalists, considerable opposition from at least some of the aboriginal groups along the route and, if all this were not enough, the likelihood of prolonged court battles.</p><p>What's not standing in the way are U.S. environmentalists, whom the Harper government accused of being the principal reasons for the project's problems. This wild statement was, then as now, completely at variance with reality, since British Columbians are hardly to be led around by their collective nose by a handful of folks from south of the border. To suggest otherwise is to insult their intelligence.</p><p>B.C. Premier Christy Clark just spent two days in Alberta, including a meeting with Alberta Premier Alison Redford that both described as frosty. Ms. Clark said she was in Alberta to inform Albertans of B.C.'s concerns and demands; but given a looming political debacle at home, she was really speaking to her home audience.</p><p>It was the height of rudeness to ask for a meeting, as Ms. Clark did, then offer nothing and not even pretend to be civil, as if the most urgent thing on her mind was telling the B.C. media how unproductive had been the meeting she sought.</p><p>But good manners flee, even between premiers of contiguous provinces, when one of them - Ms. Clark - is fighting for her political life and has come to understand how unpopular Gateway has become in British Columbia. Indeed, it would seem that the more British Columbians know about the project, the less they like it, starting with the reasonable question: Why should B.C. take most of the environmental risks for so little actual gain?</p><p>Ms. Clark, reading the political winds, has become testy about Gateway; her likely successor, NDP Leader Adrian Dix, is adamantly opposed. As are, of course, the federal New Democrats. The Harper Conservatives can steamroller the federal NDP in Parliament, but they can't so easily steamroller the B.C. government and public opinion.</p><p>Aboriginals are divided, of course, but those who're opposed can make life very difficult for Enbridge even if the NEB approves the pipeline. In fact, some aboriginal groups would take a green light to Gateway as a green light to appeal to the courts, arguing that their constitutional right to be consulted on lands they claim to be theirs was not respected, a precept articulated by the Supreme Court of Canada. At the very least, this litigation would stretch on for years.</p><p>Enbridge has not helped itself in the court of public opinion with embarrassing pipeline spills. These might be one-off affairs, explainable on technical grounds, but they looked bad and, politically, smelled worse.</p><p>The diminished prospects for Gateway make it somewhat more attractive building further pipeline capacity down the Fraser River to the Lower Mainland, where the Kinder Morgan-owned Trans Mountain pipeline already runs. The prospect of more ships in Vancouver's harbour is among the obstacles for this project.</p><p>Trains? They don't carry the capacity of pipelines. But they arouse less opposition, so that option has a better chance politically than a pipeline for bitumen to the Pacific. Shipping more oil to Eastern Canada seems to be the easiest option politically of all.</p><p>But bitumen oil to Asia through northern B.C. just ain't going to happen.</p>, <p>In the turmoil of the next year, what do you think will change people's lives the most: armed force, acts of nature, economic pressure, or personal democratic choice?</p><p>Officially, the grand narrative of 2013 will be shaped by a series of important national elections. What unites these votes, however, is the deep disconnect between the fast-changing world and the stagnant electoral choices.</p><p>This should be a good moment for democracy. According to the think tank Freedom House, about 65 per cent of the world's seven billion people now get to choose their leaders (about half of those non-democratic 35 per cent live in China).</p><p>In the past 12 months, we have seen citizens change their governments in surprising and often exciting ways in Mexico, France, South Korea, Georgia and Senegal. In Libya, people voted overwhelmingly for liberal non-Islamists; in Egypt, they chose Islamists by a slim margin in a regime that may still be military-controlled. Greece voted itself into fringe-party chaos. Russia and Venezuela stayed with strongmen in votes that can barely be called democratic. Americans surprised many by avoiding a stark regime change.</p><p>But 2013 will be defined by a series of potentially history-changing elections in some of the world's most influential countries:</p><p>Israel, Jan. 22: Yes, we know that Benjamin Netanyahu is almost certain to remain prime minister, a depressing prospect in a country that hasn't had a leader capable of properly confronting its largest challenges since 1995. Voters seem turned off by his Likud Party: Polls show him winning only 29 per cent of Knesset seats.</p><p>To keep power, Mr. Netanyahu may have to form a coalition with the even more extreme and ardently anti-Palestinian Jewish Home party, which is capturing 11 per cent in polls. Yet, Mr. Netanyahu's hatred of its leader - former adviser Naftali Bennett - is legendary. A forced marriage between these two would mark a low point in Israeli politics, and an unpopular one, not reflective of Israeli attitudes to peace and settlements. Would this prospect finally trigger a shift back to moderation, perhaps a Labour-Likud coalition? That's the best possible hope.</p><p>Italy, Feb. 24-25: The very fact that Silvio Berlusconi stands a decent chance of being elected prime minister for the fourth time shows how deeply poisoned the politics of Southern Europe have become. A man who'd probably be in prison on serious charges if he hadn't changed the laws to protect himself, the billionaire Mr. Berlusconi is, this time, positioning himself as an Occupy-style outsider populist, opposing the painful austerity measures and important new taxes that Italy has endured. His return to mainstream politics would be catastrophic, and not at all representative of the views of Italians.</p><p>Iran, June 14: The good news is that Mahmoud Ahmadinejad will not be back; Iran's two-term limit will keep the inflammatory leader out of this presidential election. And his party, the hard-line Principlist bloc, has been hurt by his very public and humiliating feud with Iran's other political force, the unelected Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. This could theoretically create an opening for reformists who seek peace with the West - but remember, Mr. Ahmadinejad owes his current presidency to the Supreme Leader's decision to declare him a winner in the fractious 2008 election and order top reformists placed under house arrest.</p><p>Could an even more conservative leader, loyal to Ayatollah Khamenei, be shunted into power? Yes, but public outrage is growing, and this might be the moment when ordinary Iranians lose all patience with their bumbling, economy-wrecking leaders and begin to take matters into their own hands.</p><p>Germany, September/October: Chancellor Angela Merkel ought to be punished at the ballot for failing to address the continent-wide currency crisis for the better part of four years, using German complacency and public cynicism at Greece to transform a recession into a catastrophe. She won't: Her Christian Democrats are poised to win again.</p><p>But watch what's happening in the margins: Her current coalition partners, the libertarian Free Democrats, are doomed. She'll likely team up with a resurgent, fiscally sensible Green Party or with the left-leaning Social Democrats - and may be more comfortable with this. Now that Germany has become the de facto leader of Europe, this shift to the centre could foretell a larger continent-wide trend.</p><p>The big changes, in Germany as elsewhere, won't be at the top but in the forces that will determine the next several years of politics. We call it representative democracy, but it's often hard to say what's being represented.</p>, <p>The Harper government is trying to get a message across: Canada is open for business, but we're not dupes.</p><p>The point is a risky one. It threatens to brand Canada internationally as hypocritical, loudly advertising that the country welcomes foreign investment, even as it rejects that proffered investment time and again - as it did this past weekend with the proposed acquisition of Progress Energy Resources Corp., by Malaysian state-owned firm Petronas.</p><p>It also threatens to undermine the Conservatives' reputation for competent economic stewardship, Prime Minister Stephen Harper's greatest political asset.</p><p>The frustrating thing, for both the Conservatives and for potential investors, is that the government believes it has no other choice. The Conservatives consider maximizing the country's resource potential, especially in energy, one of their highest economic priorities. Doing so requires capital, hundreds of billions of dollars worth, which is far more than can be raised at home.</p><p>But as a senior figure in the government, speaking on condition of anonymity, explained Sunday, the concept of globalization before the latest recession did not envision state capitalism - especially as practised by developing economies - emerging as a major source of foreign investment in developed countries.</p><p>While ivory-tower economists insist investment is investment, other governments have acted to protect strategic assets from falling into what they consider the wrong hands. The Harper government's approach has similarly evolved. The door isn't shut to foreign investment from state-owned companies, the government official said. But those companies must be transparent in their dealings and, to put it bluntly, there must be something in it for Canada: head-office jobs retained, or new money for research and investment, or the like.</p><p>Each case, the Conservatives believe, must be analyzed individually. The ad-hoc approach is messy and frustrating for all sides, but any alternative is worse.</p><p>The final decision boils down to two questions, Finance Minister Jim Flaherty told CTV's Question Period on Sunday: 'Is the proposal in the net benefit of our country and (b), are there any national security concerns?'</p><p>Answering those questions appears to be a moving target for any company trying to invest in Canadian energy resources, especially state-owned companies from countries with a less-than-stellar reputation for democracy and rule of law. The surprise rejection of the Petronas-Progress deal is bound to increase demands that the Conservatives make the rules of engagement for foreign investment more clear.</p><p>'The next message they have to send out is that: 'We are still open for business, but here are the terms in which we are open for business,'' Martin Pelletier, a portfolio manager with Trivest Wealth Counsel, told Reuters.</p><p>The Conservatives had promised exactly that, by offering greater clarity in laying out the criterion for determining what constituted 'net benefit' after the Harper government rejected the takeover of Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc. in 2010 by BHP Billiton Ltd.</p><p>But the senior official insisted any formal new rules would only make the situation worse, if a company met its commitments even though there was good reason not to let them in.</p><p>The Conservatives prefer ad hocery to Cartesian symmetry. The next great test will arrive in the coming weeks, when the Harper government finally decides whether to permit the Chinese state-owned company CNOOC Ltd. to acquire Nexen Inc., a Canadian energy firm. The government is relentlessly courting Chinese trade and investment. But how is the CNOOC proposal any different from the Petronas offer, other than being far larger? Ad hocery may be the best approach as far as the Tories are concerned, but a rejection of CNOOC/Nexen could deal a blow to Canada's relations with China, to future foreign investment in Canada, and to the government's own reputation for competence. That's the potential downside for taking what the Conservatives see as the worst possible approach to approving foreign investment proposals, except for all the others.</p>, <p>Scarborough has been in the news lately for all the wrong reasons. Now is a good time to take a step back from the hyperbole surrounding last week's shooting and put this part of Toronto in perspective, in support of a place I love and serve.</p><p>Scarborough is on the leading edge of Toronto's march toward greater cultural and economic diversity.</p><p>The neighbourhoods and communities that make up Scarborough are Toronto's most ethnically diverse, including people from South Asia, Asia, the Caribbean, Europe, Africa, the Philippines, the Middle East, the British Isles and just about everywhere else on the globe. Scarborough is mostly free from the cultural frictions such diversity often engenders, making it a harbinger of Toronto's future. Diversity works in Scarborough.</p><p>Scarborough has the same problems as other areas with priority neighbourhoods and at-risk youth.</p><p>Youth gun violence has taken place in a variety of Toronto neighbourhoods - Jane-Finch, downtown, Lawrence Heights, Etobicoke. What happened in Scarborough last week is just the latest manifestation. While we must take preventative action, we must also avoid knee-jerk reactions and take the time to develop effective solutions.</p><p>Much of the youth crime in Scarborough and elsewhere in Toronto can be connected to an ill-conceived and chronically underfunded public-housing strategy, combined with a shortage of community-based resources.</p><p>A large portion of Toronto's public housing was created by the province and dumped on the city during amalgamation, beginning in 1998. It was designed around an old, now discredited model that ghettoized poverty in large housing projects - a model that has created intractable problems nearly everywhere it's been tried. It tends to institutionalize poverty and create a culture of chronic dependency, despair and often violence. Toronto's public housing problem has been compounded by the downloading of an aging property inventory without providing sufficient funding to maintain or improve it. Significantly, Scarborough has the largest pool of public housing units in the city.</p><p>Without jobs there is little hope.</p><p>Gang membership can be an attractive option for young people with little hope of finding meaningful work. Any effective program to fight poverty-related crime must include employment opportunities and job training. Toronto's new work force development strategy, announced in February, aims to bring the public and private sectors together to reinvigorate the city's job market. Providing employment opportunities for young people in at-risk neighbourhoods is an important element in this strategy.</p><p>There are no quick or simple solutions to a problem that has developed over generations.</p><p>Broken families, a lack of jobs and chronic poverty are among the numerous factors that provide fertile ground for gangs, drugs and violence. The 2008 Review of the Roots of Youth Violence report, commissioned by the province and prepared by Roy McMurtry and Alvin Curling, identifies many of these conditions and makes thoughtful and comprehensive recommendations. I suggest that the province revisit this report and take further steps to implement it. I also suggest that the province work with Toronto to bolster the city's priority neighbourhoods initiative, which has achieved some success but will soon be starved of funding.</p><p>It is a mistake to define a neighbourhood by random acts of violence.</p><p>Scarborough is made up of thousands of good people who are proud of their community and ready to help others in need. Each Christmas, the call goes out for volunteers to assemble food baskets for needy families. Each year, hundreds of volunteers respond, including scores of young people. With their help, more than 300 families receive a month's worth of food.</p><p>When the Taste of Lawrence festival takes over Lawrence Avenue each summer, hundreds of thousands of residents and visitors take to the street in peace to sample international food, enjoy carnival rides and concerts and absorb the vibe of our celebrated diversity.</p><p>This is the Scarborough I know, the place where I live and the community that I am proud to represent.</p><p>Michael Thompson is Toronto city councillor for Scarborough Centre, Ward 37. He is chair of the city's economic development and culture committee and vice-chair of the Toronto Police Services Board.</p>, <p>The Newtown killer's weapon of choice was his mother's Bushmaster .233. One selling feature of this deadly semi-automatic weapon is its light weight - good for women. It is 'surprisingly easy to manoeuvre, even for a novice,' said a New York Times report. 'It doesn't have to be recocked after it's fired: You just squeeze the trigger over and over.'</p><p>The killer's mother, Nancy Lanza, was just another ordinary American mom with an arsenal. In the sprawling semi-rural exurbs where she lived, plenty of homeowners have guns for self-defence. Nancy would not have been a fan of gun control. She came from New Hampshire, whose official motto is Live Free or Die. I doubt that when she took her son out target shooting, she ever worried he might kill her with one of her own weapons, then take the Bushmaster to the local school.</p><p>'These tragedies must end,' Barack Obama told a grief-stricken nation Sunday. Don't count on it. Guns are more American than mom and apple pie. Gun ownership is entwined with the nation's DNA. Every time more innocents are massacred, we hear: The answer isn't fewer guns, but more! We should repeal gun bans in school zones! If only their teachers had been armed to the teeth, those kids would be alive today. 'Gun control supporters,' insisted Larry Pratt, executive director of Gun Owners of America, 'have the blood of little children on their hands.'</p><p>This love affair with guns is not susceptible to logic. And Americans' beliefs about their right to weapons are essentially religious. For them, the Constitution is a sacred document that can no more be altered than the Ten Commandments. Their foundation myth is of a citizen army of brave patriots who took up arms to free themselves from a distant tyranny. Unfortunately, the Second Amendment was written in the age of flintlocks. It never anticipated the Bushmaster and the Glock.</p><p>When it seems every other mommy's got a Glock, gun reform is hard. The U.S. is awash in 270-million weapons. Forty-seven per cent of U.S. households have a gun, and only 25 per cent of Americans want stricter gun laws, according to a recent Gallup poll. Three other myths fuel Americans' bond with firearms. One is the wild frontier, where lone heroes brought justice to a savage land. (I can still hum the theme song from Have Gun, Will Travel.) Another is the fear that violent criminals lurk everywhere. (If guns are controlled, only police and criminals will have them.) The other is that a catastrophic breakdown of society could occur at any time, probably when the economy collapses. This view is not confined to nutty people who live in the backwoods. It is also held by people who live in nice neighbourhoods and have safes full of weapons, just in case.</p><p>Irrational fears are hard to dislodge with facts. Crime rates are way down. Yet many states, by popular demand, have expanded gun rights. Even Barack Obama has expanded gun rights. He signed a law allowing firearms to be carried in national parks, and another allowing guns in checked baggage on Amtrack trains. Gun opponents call his record on gun control an 'abject failure.'</p><p>The U.S. is the most heavily armed nation in the world. Fortunately, it is by no means the most trigger-happy. According to one of the many surveys out there, this one published in the Guardian, that distinction goes to Brazil, Colombia, Venezuela, South Africa, and a bunch of countries in the Caribbean, where rates of gun murder are 10 or even 20 times higher. The Swiss, by contrast, have a lot of guns but very little gun crime. So does Canada.</p><p>What sets the United States apart is not the amount of weaponry, or the crime rate. It is the nature of the crime. Only the United States specializes in the kind of unfathomable horror we saw this weekend - the horror that stretches from Columbine to Virginia Tech, Tucson to Aurora, and repeats itself over and over.</p><p>And then everyone says never again, until the next time.</p>, <p>The growing household debt of Canadians who should be in their prime savings years reflects demographic changes that will alter the nature of retirement, in ways that have some surprisingly positive sides. They may be 'punch-drunk' on low interest rates, as a report by CIBC economist Avery Shenfeld suggests, but they are also responding in natural and often productive ways to the exigencies of raising children later in life.</p><p>Even apart from the deceptively sweet punch of mortgage rates at 3 per cent and credit lines secured to homes at 4 per cent, it's easy to see why people are taking on higher debt loads than previous generations of people 45-plus: They are having children in their 40s and 50s. They are supporting multiple households as a result of divorce and remarriage. Their children need to pay postsecondary tuition costs that are far higher than they used to be, and they need more years of study to gain an edge in the job market.</p><p>People are continuing to take on debt past age 45 for a mix of reasons - because they must and because they can. To some extent, the willingness to go deeper into debt reflects a confidence in themselves and their ability to continue making a living, the economy that provides that living and the housing market in which much of their wealth is tied up.</p><p>The downside is well-known. They might become infirm. The economy could go into recession. The housing market could undergo a United States-style crash. Interest rates could (and no doubt will) rise again to more normal levels. The risks are manifold. It is far from ideal to carry a large debt load into later years.</p><p>But there are positive sides, too. With all that debt, they will need to find continued sources of income. Many will need (and some may even want) to keep working in some form, to be entrepreneurial. Need drives innovation, and Canada will see an unleashing of creativity from older people. And the investments they make in their children's education (and travel, sports and music) will pay off down the road.</p><p>This is not a generation on a precipice, as Mr. Shenfeld and a second CIBC economist, Benjamin Tal, acknowledge in a second report. 'The danger instead is that low interest rates lose their power to propel growth,' they write. In other words, the bigger danger is to the economy - if people stop borrowing.</p><p>Everything about the new generation now headed for the 'retirement years' will be different from its predecessors - its family makeup, its aspirations (people aren't as likely to downsize, especially with so many adult children returning home) and its tendency to keep borrowing. It's risky to be punch-drunk, and many people are courting more than a bit of risk; but in risk is the possibility of growth.</p>, <p>A First Nations Education Act could arrive before Parliament this year, aimed at breaking the cycle of failure on reserve schools and representing one of the most important and unexpected priorities for the Harper government.</p><p>So far, this new initiative has been masked by accusations and controversy over who's to blame for the crisis conditions at Attawapiskat, or discussion on whether natives on reserves should be given property rights.</p><p>But native education is where the Conservatives hope to make their mark, and they just might succeed.</p><p>An important but largely overlooked report from the Senate committee on aboriginal peoples, chaired by Tory Senator Gerry St. Germain and supported by Senate Liberals, arrived in December urging legislation to create a native education system.</p><p>The report is getting a favourable response from key decision makers within the Harper government, according to sources.</p><p>Virtually every student in this country who does not live on reserve attends a school that is operated by a school board, that is presided over by a provincial ministry of education.</p><p>But there is no education system for native communities. There are just schools on reserves run by band councils. Many of those isolated schools are staffed by inexperienced teachers, who are often paid less than those who teach in public schools. They work in inadequate buildings that have no computers or libraries, but plenty of mould. They teach children who desperately need above-average, not grossly below-average, support.</p><p>'In time, some will be lost to themselves, to their families and communities, and to this country,' the report concludes.</p><p>Many chiefs, especially younger ones just arriving on the scene, recognize that ending generations of poverty, ill health and joblessness on reserves begins with properly educating this generation of students.</p><p>In Nova Scotia, British Columbia and elsewhere, reserves are banding together to create native school boards that, with the help of provincial governments, pool resources, set standards and adopt a common curriculum that teaches native language and culture along with math, science and language arts. While fewer than half of native students on reserves graduate from high school nationally, the figure for Mi'kmaw students in Nova Scotia - most of whom attend a combination of reserve and provincial schools - is over 70 per cent.</p><p>The Senate report proposes building on that model with legislation that would encourage - but not compel - native leaders across the country to co-operate in establishing school boards and even the native equivalent of education ministries, with federal education funding flowing through the new authorities.</p><p>Another report, jointly commissioned by the Assembly of First Nations and the government, from a panel chaired by YMCA president Scott Haldane, is expected to provide specifics on how a national program to create native school boards might work.</p><p>That report arrives in early February, not long after Prime Minister Stephen Harper meets with native chiefs in Ottawa to discuss education and other matters.</p><p>The thinking is that the summit, the two reports and the growing co-operation between the chiefs and the Conservatives - on the education issue, if nothing else - could provide sufficient impetus for a First Nations Education Act that most chiefs would support. If all goes well, Aboriginal Affairs Minister John Duncan could present the bill to the House during the fall session.</p><p>Money, of course, will be the key. For 15 years, first nations education funding has grown at a rate of 2 per cent annually, far below the increases for provincial schools. Mr. Harper has let it be known that he is willing to put money into a first-nations education system that is effective and accountable, which is why the Tories are attracted to the idea of school boards.</p><p>None of this will be easy. This country has a horrible history of using education to undermine native culture, so we should expect a lot of resistance to any education act, even if some chiefs do endorse it.</p><p>Still, the Conservatives have gone much farther down this path than anyone would have predicted. As has already been observed, this really could be Stephen Harper's equivalent of Nixon going to China.</p>, <p>It's hard to argue with Premier Christy Clark's motivation for wanting to sign a 10-year accord with the province's K-12 teachers. A decade of labour peace with educators and their ever-combative union would be a blessing. Parents and students would unquestionably be the big winners in such a deal.</p><p>But as well-meaning as the idea is, it is equally far-fetched. I hate to temper the Premier's enthusiasm for the proposal with cold logic, but I must. A 10-year labour agreement with the teachers will never happen because it is neither in the teachers' nor the government's long-term interests.</p><p>Let's consider just one aspect of such a pact that could come back to haunt the government: wage increases. How any government could predict what it might be able to pay its workers 10 years down the road is just one problem with this plan. But let's say, for the sake of argument, the government decided to tie the wage increases to inflation with other fiscal benchmarks around measures such as GDP perhaps triggering additional monies.</p><p>So, let's agree the negotiated funding formula means annual increases of between 1 and 3 per cent over the life of the contract. So far, maybe so good. But then in year three of the deal, the bottom falls out of commodity markets. The price of natural gas plummets, among other things. (And that's not implausible at all.) The provincial treasury takes a nasty hit.</p><p>Also consider that we're still feeling the aftershocks of the financial crisis. No one yet knows how events in Europe will ultimately shake down and affect the rest of the world. There are plenty of unknowns. Point being, the financial position of the B.C. government could change radically in a year, let alone 10.</p><p>Suddenly, it is on the hook for wage increases to teachers that it cannot afford but is obligated to pay. It is in fiscal handcuffs. What happens to all of the other public-sector workers? What is the government going to have to say to them? Sorry, but the state of our finances prevents us from being able to offer you any wage increase.</p><p>You know what those unions are going to say: But you gave the teachers a raise. And you pretty much guaranteed them one for the next seven years. How is that fair?</p><p>It would not be.</p><p>Similarly, although not as likely, the teachers could sign a contract that gives them raises tied to inflation while other unions are signing contracts with wage increases in excess of that because, suddenly, the government finds itself awash in money. As I say, not as probable, but not impossible either. Would the teachers take that chance? Beyond that, who knows what issues the teachers might need addressed three, four, even five years out from when such a contract was approved. Their priorities almost certainly will shift over the course of a 10-year deal. What opportunities would there be to reopen such a deal to address new concerns? And if you could reopen the contract, doesn't that defeat the purpose of it?</p><p>When I put these issues to the Premier this week, she acknowledged there are legitimate questions about the impact of such a deal elsewhere in the public service. But she said the government's investment in kids and education is the single most important one it makes in its citizens.</p><p>'Yes, it's difficult to do and it's not something we've ever done before, but I think it's a risk we have to think about taking given the importance of what we're talking about,' she said.</p><p>Ms. Clark said there are different ways of mapping out agreements that would allow some flexibility to respond to unexpected scenarios. She admitted, however, that she has no idea how such a deal would ultimately be structured.</p><p>'But I would say that I think negotiating a teachers' agreement is different than negotiating any other agreement out there,' she said.</p><p>If, by that statement, she is insinuating that teachers enjoy some kind of special status among equals, I think doctors and nurses, among others, might have something to say about that. In fact, I'm sure every other public-sector union would, too.</p><p>Ms. Clark is right that, in the past, the province was able to sign a five-year deal with teachers and that her plan would simply double that. But doubling it at least triples the complications.</p><p>Often, a government doesn't negotiate labour peace as much as it buys it. A 10-year labour agreement with B.C. teachers could be achieved, but it would likely be horribly expensive - far too costly, in fact, for any sane government even to consider.</p>, <p>Call it the final taming - the final domestication - of capitalism.</p><p>In February, a French commercial court ruled that Google Inc. broke the law when it allowed people in France to use Google Maps for free. Declaring the practice 'unfair,' the court ordered the company to pay Bottin Cartographes, a French competitor, EUR500,000 in damages and a EUR15,000 fine. The court ignored the fact that Google Maps are a strategic service that enables the company to make money by giving things away. It also ignored the fact that OpenStreetMap, a wiki-based free service, has already mapped the world. (Google says it will appeal.)</p><p>We're not talking mere predatory pricing. We're not talking mere monopoly. We're talking 'competitive harm' - the insidious notion that every transaction, one way or another, is inherently unfair. As noted U.S. legal scholar Richard Epstein explained nearly a decade ago (inFree Markets Under Siege), competitive harm implies that every single transaction 'may often leave in its wake one or more disappointed competitors who are worse off in this particular instance because of their inability to make the sale.' Hence, in all fairness, every single lost sale might qualify for compensation - by the company that makes a sale to the companies that don't.</p><p>It has taken a century to turn capitalism from an awesome force of nature, rude, raw and rambunctious, to the subservient thing it is today. Writing more recently, Mr. Epstein described contemporary capitalism as a spent force - trending, at least, to stagnation (from Latin: swamp). In the advanced economies, growth turned sluggish (in real-dollar terms) a generation ago. Now these exhausted economies, deep in debt, struggle to crank out a single percentage point of real-dollar growth a year.</p><p>In economic terms, life should be zestier than this - not for the rich but for ordinary people. In his riveting narrativeAmerican Colossus: The Triumph of Capitalism, 1865-1900, U.S. historian H.W. Brands describes the 19th-century capitalist revolution as 'the best thing ever to befall the ordinary people of America.' In this 35-year period, the country's population grew from 40 million to 70 million. Infant mortality fell by a third. Life expectancy increased to 50 years from 43. Industrial production tripled (in real-dollar terms) and average per capita income doubled. The percentage of people living on farms fell by a half - yet the people who remained outproduced their forebears by a huge margin.</p><p>Modern technologies emerged to make life better for the masses. Electricity, telephones, phonographs, movies. Air conditioning appeared in public buildings and offices - 'in 1902, lowering temperatures and tempers on the New York Stock Exchange.' Gas-powered cars, airplanes, railways. In unprecedented ways, people were on the move - across the country and around the world. In 1900, 125,000 Americans crossed oceans on their vacations. Although the number of Americans who travelled to Canada every year isn't known, their spending is: Between 1865 and 1900, it quintupled.</p><p>In all its laissez-faire exuberance, as Mr. Brands tells it, capitalism came close to obliterating democracy in the United States, 'the world's archetype of capitalist democracy.' Breaking on the world with simultaneous revolutionary impact in 1776, Adam Smith'sWealth of Nations and Thomas Jefferson's Declaration of Independence defined the two primary motivating impulses of the New World: personal freedom in economics, personal liberty in government - with the two forces in relentless opposition. When the anarchist Leon Czolgosz shot president William McKinley twice in September of 1901, he did so to overthrow capitalism. He didn't succeed - but he did bring to power the populist, progressive Theodore Roosevelt, who began the slow (and, indeed, essential) policing of capitalism.</p><p>Getting the right balance between economic and political freedoms isn't as easy as ideological rhetoric makes it appear. The Google Map judgment suggests that pretentious political doctrine is now throttling the basic economic principles of trade and commerce - making it much harder to produce the wealth that sustains the greatest prosperity the world has ever known. As tough as he was on the great industrialists of his day, Roosevelt advised caution in putting capitalism in its place. 'The captains of industry ... have, on the whole, done great good to our people,' he declared. It remains to be seen whether the same will be said of the captains of state capitalism in the 21st century.</p>, <p>In Israel this week, Foreign Affairs Minister John Baird declared it would be a lot easier for the Harper government to go along with criticisms of Israel if it wanted to win votes. Then a poll found half of Canadians think the government has struck the right balance on the Middle East.</p><p>It means the government has plenty of political room in which to keep up a staunch pro-Israel policy.</p><p>There's little doubt Stephen Harper's government has taken a decidedly more pro-Israel tone. Mr. Baird underlined it in his speech Monday, saying Israel has no better friend than Canada.</p><p>Many assumed for years that Canadians want their government to stay neutral on Mideast issues. So this new poll, given the government's shift in tone, seems to turn that on its head.</p><p>The Environics Institute poll found 48 per cent think the Harper government's policy on Israeli-Palestinian issues 'strikes the right balance.' Another 23 per cent said it is too pro-Israel, 3 per cent said it is too pro-Palestinian, and 27 per cent didn't know.</p><p>The results are a surprise to some who have been involved in Canada's Middle East policy. Past polls, like a 2007 survey sponsored by the BBC, have found more Canadians have a negative view of Israel than a positive one. They believed something like neutrality was the public will.</p><p>Was the assumption wrong? Have views changed?</p><p>Notably, the answer Canadians have given to the question in the Environics Institute poll hasn't changed much in recent years. Forty-nine per cent thought prime minister Jean Chretien's Liberals struck the right balance back in 2001. Keith Neuman, executive director of the Environics Institute, said the public hasn't changed its assessment as the Conservative government changed policy.</p><p>Why not? Depends who you ask. Shimon Fogel, CEO of the Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs, says most Canadians never thought 'balanced' meant never taking sides, as many in the bureaucracy and elites did.</p><p>'I don't think Canadians were ever interested in us being neutral. But they are interested in us having a balanced, thoughtful approach,' he said. 'Canadians were not necessarily aware or understanding of what a balanced approach looks like. In an earlier time, it was interchangeable with neutral - we praise one thing, we criticize the other.'</p><p>Canadians, he argued, like the sense their government speaks directly in a dysfunctional debate. But Ottawa retains the level of balance they want, he said - supporting negotiations toward a two-state solution and offering aid to the Palestinian Authority.</p><p>On the other side, Rula Odeh, a board member of the National Council on Canada-Arab Relations, thinks Canadians just don't know the government's positions are out of step with theirs.</p><p>She noted the same poll found Canadians disagree with the government on a specific policy: 36 per cent supported the Palestinian bid to be recognized as a state by the UN, while 11 per cent opposed it. The government has vocally criticized the bid.</p><p>Mr. Neuman suggests the fact 53 per cent had no opinion on that question is a clue to the real bottom line. A small proportion feel directly invested in the issue, but most don't follow the twists of Canadian policy, he said.</p><p>Another pollster, who declined to be named because his surveys on the issue are confidential, said it's more than that. Most Canadians turn off. It's complicated and intractable in their eyes, and they don't have high hopes for a solution, he said: 'Most don't see a white hat in that fight.'</p><p>The politicians will watch for the small numbers who are intensely interested, and what ridings they live in, particularly in the Jewish community and among some Muslim-Canadians, and some others. But there's little broad reaction in public opinion. 'It suggests the government has some latitude,' Mr. Neuman said.</p><p>The upshot is that the Harper government has political space for its staunchly pro-Israel foreign policy. They aren't running into a brick wall of public opinion, far from it. They have political leeway. You can bet they already knew that.</p>, <p>History does repeat itself, it would appear.</p><p>Pierre Trudeau had his constitutional conferences that involved aboriginal leaders. Brian Mulroney had his too, plus a big session in British Columbia to launch the B.C. Treaty Commission process, which has been a discouraging flop.</p><p>Jean Chretien often went on about how splendidly he got along with the chiefs, having been Indian Affairs minister early in his career. Paul Martin had his Kelowna Accord. Stephen Harper had his reconciliation/apology statement over residential schools and, Tuesday, a day-long session with the chiefs.</p><p>Along the way, the national leadership of the Assembly of First Nations has obviously changed, as have the local chiefs. But the dialogue seldom changes, on either side of the table. Sonorous cliches mix with history lessons about 'settlers' and their perfidy, lessons are repeated about the 'honour of the Crown' and treaties that are/were not respected. Discreet references are offered about the discouraging economic and social statistics of aboriginal people, complaints are aired about insufficient public funding, occasional threats are made about the potential for violence and then things continue pretty much as before, out there in the real world, far removed from the conferences with their ceremonies and solemnities.</p><p>The Department of Indian Affairs recognizes 615 first nations. Within that tapestry are 60 languages, most of which are in decline for lack of population. According to the last Statistics Canada survey (2006), 29 per cent of aboriginals said they could speak well enough to carry on a conversation in their native language. Off reserve, the figure fell to 12 per cent.</p><p>Slowly, aboriginals are drifting away from reserves (where the chiefs dominate) because, despite whatever cultural support the reserves provide, many have little or no economic base, which is the real story behind the headlines about social and housing problems along James Bay.</p><p>Speaking of housing, that same Statistics Canada survey found 44 per cent of houses on reserve were in need of 'major repairs' - up from 36 per cent in 1966 - compared with 9 per cent of homes in rural Canada. What accounts for such shocking indifference?</p><p>Is it because property ownership barely exists, so a renter mentality takes over? Is it because the people living in the houses have lost self-respect? Is it because the houses are often crowded, or poorly made to begin with? Is it because governments haven't spent enough money, the usual answer from communities? Where are the chiefs who are supposed to be running their communities? Whatever the explanations, such dilapidation is a scandal, and one reason, among many, for the drift away from reserves.</p><p>Tuesday, education was much on everyone's mind, as it has been at previous conferences. The gaps between aboriginal and non-aboriginal education accomplishments are wide and dangerous - dangerous because poor education stunts economic opportunities and can lead to dead-end lives.</p><p>Native chiefs insist that communities should run their own school systems, which makes sense in some but not all cases. They also complain, not without reason, that funding has not kept pace, with their birth rate being so much higher than the Canadian average.</p><p>What aboriginal groups really need is more economic opportunity of the kind that comes with education and a bigger share in development projects. If aboriginals have land with natural resources to be extracted, or pipelines or hydro lines to cross it, then they should benefit from royalties, direct ownership and jobs.</p><p>This sharing will definitely help some aboriginal communities, but will leave others with little because their lands are too isolated. There's also the fact that 60 per cent of aboriginals now live off the reserves. They might share in the royalties negotiated by their reserve, but resource projects won't help them in large- or even medium-sized cities.</p><p>Economic development, and how to achieve it, will be at the heart of the discussions between Mr. Harper's government and the chiefs. It's the kind of language the Conservatives understand and favour, and it's what aboriginal leaders want.</p><p>It will also be at the heart of the re-election campaign of AFN national chief Shawn Atleo, who will be seriously challenged, and possibly unseated, at July's convention in Toronto.</p>, <p>Follow the trial of James Holmes - charged with killing 12 people at a Batman screening in Colorado - and inevitable questions come up. What makes a seemingly 'normal' young man turn violent? Was he ill? Or born bad?</p><p>And does knowing what makes killers kill do anything to prevent murder? Globe columnist Margaret Wente leads a discussion with U.S. author and criminologist James Fox and Canadian lawyer and journalist Paula Todd, who has just published a book about Karla Homolka, about making sense of senseless tragedy.</p><p>MW: Even talking about killers is controversial right now. Should we pay attention to people like James Holmes? Or are we pushing them into the spotlight, making them famous?</p><p>JF: It's okay to shed light on crime, but not to spotlight criminals. It makes them larger than life, and humanizes a people who have committed tremendously inhumane acts.</p><p>MW: Is your concern that criminals like Mr. Holmes might be bad examples?</p><p>JF: Possibly. Murderers have uttered the names of their predecessors. But I also think it debases our society when we know murderers so well. In one of my classes at Northeastern University I ask students to write down the names of five serial killers, then the names of five vice-presidents. They can't do the vice-presidents. They're much more interested in bloody gore than Al Gore.</p><p>MW: What about you, Paula? When your book Finding Karla, about Karla Homolka, came out, many people wondered why you didn't just let her rot in obscurity?</p><p>PT: I saw fairly knowledgeable reports that she was teaching children in another country and I was concerned about them. I know when she disappeared in 2007 some Canadians gave a sigh of relief - she's gone and that's good. But it felt odd to me. And in some ways she hasn't left here, either. When it comes to sentencing, criminal courts will say, 'Well, don't let her get away with it. Don't let it be Karla Homolka.' We've made her into this mythic figure - a cunning, genius psychopath, or malignant narcissist, who will kill again.</p><p>MW: What about the argument that we need to talk about killers, and the details of their lives, to understand the root causes of evil?</p><p>JF: I hear stories about killers' favourite ice cream. Often we hear excessive details that have absolutely nothing to do with motivation, with identifying evil. Then we do biographies about killers and put them on A&E or the History channel. Or we make a movie, like Monster, with Charlize Theron as a serial killer. It blurs the distinction between a murderer and a celebrity.</p><p>And I think we're fooling ourselves that we can actually create an instruction manual for identifying future killers. There are tens of thousands of Americans and Canadians who fit the profile of someone like the shooter in Colorado. We can see them, they're depressed, they're angry, they're always complaining that someone else is taking credit for their achievements, that the government is corrupt and they're isolated. It doesn't mean they'll go on a rampage.</p><p>MW: And yet Dave Cullen, who wrote a bestselling book on the Columbine school murders, has argued that, in the case of Dylan Klebold - who was cleary depressed and morose - better mental health services could have forestalled his crime.</p><p>JF: The ones that are truly dangerous, who will go after other people, aren't likely to take up offers of help. They'll say, 'I'm not a problem, you're the problem.'</p><p>PT: But Mr. Holmes apparently mailed a local psychiatrist a notebook - complete with stick figures and diagrams - about how he was going to carry out his mass murder. Does that not sound like somebody who wanted help? And yet he went on to kill.</p><p>JF: There are people who send out warning signs, for sure. But even those people may never commit murder. There's nothing we've learned that helps us recognize which troubled people will go on a rampage. Hindsight is 20/20: We look back at all these warning signs and say, 'Gee, yeah, obviously these things were missed.' But no one, even a psychiatrist, can really anticipate events like this.</p>, <p>The real environmentalists, says U.S. energy analyst Robert Bryce, are farmers who use pesticides. Writing in the winter issue of City Journal, magazine of the Manhattan Institute, Mr. Bryce notes that global production of cereal crops doubled between 1968 and 2005 though agricultural acreage remained the same: 3.7 billion acres. Citing U.S. Department of the Interior research, he reports that - without chemically intensive agriculture - the world would have needed another 4.3 billion acres to feed itself in the same 40-year period. 'Where in the world - literally - would we have found an extra 4.3 billion acres of land,' he asks, 'an area just slightly smaller than South America?'</p><p>Fortunately, says Mr. Bryce, world agriculture didn't go organic in the 1960s - or, for that matter, since. Farmland used for organic cultivation on a large scale produces 23 per cent less corn, per acre, than conventional agriculture, 50 per cent less wheat. Extrapolated to global dimensions, organic farming could have seriously reduced the world's food supply.</p><p>Yet the world will confront almost as big a task in the next 40 years or 50 years as it did in the last 40 or 50. Population will increase by 2.3 billion (to 9.3 billion); combined with rising affluence in the developing world, the world will need to increase food production by another 70 per cent - or more. The UN's Food and Agriculture Organization, for its part, says that 90 per cent of the additional calories needed by 2050 'will have to come through higher yields per acre.'</p><p>Mr. Bryce is a Texas-based author and journalist (The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, Atlantic Monthly) who is now a senior fellow at the Center for Energy Policy and the Environment at the Manhattan Institute, a conservative New York think tank. In his latest essay (titled Get Dense), he argues that the environmental assessment of any fuel must include its 'power density' - the amount of energy that can be harnessed from any given amount of land. He says that corn ethanol, for example, produces only 0.05 watts per square metre of land. By contrast, a small natural-gas well (producing only 60,000 cubic feet of gas a day) has a power density of 28 watts per square metre.</p><p>Indeed, the power density of ethanol is so low that, in 2011, the U.S. corn-ethanol industry needed to convert 'a mind-boggling 4.9 billion bushels of grain' to produce 0.6 per cent (in energy equivalent terms) of global oil production. The industry used more than 40 per cent of U.S. corn production for fuel. 'That's more corn,' Mr. Bryce says, 'than thecombined outputs of the European Union, Mexico, Argentina and India.'</p><p>Writing last year in Scientific American, Tim Searchinger, a research scholar at the Woodrow Wilson School at Princeton University, reported that heavily subsidized production of biofuels has almost doubled the demand for grain and sugar in the past seven years. 'Our primary obligation is to feed the hungry,' he asserted. 'Biofuels are undermining our ability to do so.'</p><p>Governments think differently. 'We can break our dependence on oil,' President Barack Obama declared last year, 'with biofuels.' Congress authorized $7-billion in subsidies to prove him right. The administration now favours celluloid (switchgrass) ethanol over corn ethanol - but gargantuan quantities would be required to make much of a difference. Mr. Bryce says you would need to harvest every square inch of Illinois (36.9 million acres) to replace 10 per cent of U.S. oil consumption.</p><p>From the same perspective, you would need to build 770 square miles of wind turbines to produce the electricity now supplied by the Indian Point nuclear power plant, which supplies the city of New York with 30 per cent of its electricity. Indian Point's power density? Mr. Bryce puts it at 2,000 watts per square metre. But wind turbines use (and, some argue, despoil) more than large stretches of land. Each turbine weighs 200 tons and generates 0.02 megawatts of electricity per ton. By comparison, General Electric's LM6000 natural gas-fired turbine weighs nine tons and generates 4.7 megawatts per ton (or 230 times as much).</p><p>Thus, the folk who drill natural-gas wells and who operate nuclear power plants are, for Mr. Bryce, real environmentalists, too. It's an interesting perspective. Our air is obviously a precious thing. But so is our land. Mr. Bryce gives new meaning to an oft-claimed (but honestly elusive) iconic environmental designation: friends of the Earth.</p>, <p>'Christy got it done!' says a B.C. Liberal Party flyer distributed in anticipation of a by-election this spring.</p><p>Dennis Marsden, the B.C. Liberal candidate for the Port Moody-Coquitlam by-election, is running on Christy Clark's track record as premier. Her effort to put the Evergreen transit line 'on track' is featured prominently in his campaign literature.</p><p>'Within months of taking office, Premier Christy Clark broke the logjam and got the Evergreen Line underway,' the campaign flyer says. 'The Evergreen Line had been stalled for years. It took strong leadership from Christy to get it done.'</p><p>Even by the loose standards for political spin, the audacity in giving Ms. Clark credit for moving the project forward is stunning.</p><p>After she was chosen as premier by Liberal Party members in February, 2011, Ms. Clark had to backtrack twice on the issue, once over a carbon tax and once over a fuel tax. She appeared to be floundering, attuned to neither municipal politics nor the views of her cabinet colleagues.</p><p>Meanwhile, the projected completion date for construction of the transit line kept being pushed back. The province blamed municipal leaders for the delay, but Ms. Clark's confused interventions may have also gummed up the process.</p><p>The $1.4-billion Evergreen transit line, linking Coquitlam, Port Moody and Burnaby, has been a political thorn in the side of the Liberal government for years. TransLink initially endorsed a transit line that was to be completed by 2009. However, the provincial government gave priority to construction of the Canada Line, from the airport to downtown, in time for the 2010 Olympics.</p><p>Financing the municipal contribution to the project has been a huge issue throughout the years. The federal government pitched in $417-million; the province, $583-million. The municipalities had to come up with $400-million.</p><p>Ms. Clark stepped into the debate on May 6, with an open letter to British Columbians. 'In the future I am open to considering using the carbon tax to support regional initiatives, such as public transit,' she stated.</p><p>Former premier Gordon Campbell had introduced the tax to encourage the reduction of carbon emissions. To ensure that the 'green' initiative was not seen as a tax grab, he committed the government to using all the revenue to reduce taxes.</p><p>The province's annual provincial budget includes a full account on how the government designates those revenues. The carbon tax will raise $1.17-billion in the 2012 fiscal year beginning April 1. All those funds and more are already committed to personal and business tax cuts, leaving no room for public transit subsidies. The budget links tax cuts worth $1.27-billion to the carbon tax.</p><p>It took less than a month for Ms. Clark's 'open letter' to be shelved. Transportation Minister Blair Lekstrom told the legislature in June that the Evergreen line would not be financed by the current carbon tax.</p><p>Ms. Clark fumbled the issue again in July. Metro Vancouver mayors came with a proposal to hike the 15-cents-a-litre fuel tax for transit to 17 cents. Ms. Clark balked at the suggestion.</p><p>'When British Columbians say they're not really excited about seeing more gas taxes, I get that. Because my focus as Premier is how do we make life more affordable for people, rather than less affordable,' Ms. Clark told reporters. 'So I'm going to give them a little more time to think about some of these issues, and we'll get into discussions with them once they come up with their best answers.'</p><p>Ms. Clark backtracked more quickly this time. Two days later, she endorsed the mayors' proposal. Her flip-flop was reported as one of the factors in the decision not to hold a provincial election last year.</p><p>Last fall, the legislature approved the two-cents-a-litre increase, effective in April. Construction of the Evergreen Line is now under way, despite Ms. Clark's missteps. The target date for the start of service is the summer of 2016.</p>, <p>Jon Stovell has taken the pulse of the Janion building in Victoria's Old Town and deems the derelict structure worth saving.</p><p>While others are daunted by the decay, he welcomes the challenge of preserving and rehabilitating the three-storey brick building on a gritty corner of downtown Victoria. The Janion was built in 1891 and had a varied life as everything from a hotel to a warehouse, but it has been vacant for more than 35 years. 'When we see Old Town, we see miraculous potential for retaining beautiful heritage buildings in what could become an incredibly vibrant area,' said Mr. Stovell, president of Reliance Properties.</p><p>Reliance, with the help of Merrick Architecture in Victoria, plans to restore the run-down Janion and turn it into a condo complex that will house 113 microlofts. Old Town has its charms, but the neighbourhood lacks a concentration of residents who are needed to breathe new life into the area. Old Town has survived a long period of decline, marked by high vacancy rates in aging buildings or, in the case of the Janion, decades of neglect. 'You need a dense population base that will drive people into the nooks and crannies. It is such an amazing opportunity,' said Mr. Stovell, a former president of the Gastown Business Improvement Association in Vancouver.</p><p>To attract a new crowd of condo dwellers who will embrace the notion that small is beautiful (and affordable), Reliance plans to offer Janion units at a starting price of $110,000 for a humble abode of 248 square feet - roughly the size of a one-car garage. While some units will be more than 800 square feet, the average will be 360 square feet. About half of the microlofts are to be offered for less than $150,000 each, featuring built-in flat-screen TVs and flip-up wall beds.</p><p>Twenty-six of the condo units will be in the original Janion on Store Street. Behind the brick building, the remaining 87 units will be located in a six-storey wing to be built on former Transport Canada land that slopes down to the waterfront, just north of the Johnson Street Bridge. Work on the Janion project is slated to begin this summer, with completion targeted by the end of 2015.</p><p>Vancouver-based Reliance, which acquired the Janion property last year, is also keen to revitalize two historic Victoria warehouses known as Northern Junk. Those two structures, dating back to the 1860s, are on the south side of the blue-coloured Johnson Street Bridge. The aging crossing itself will be torn down after a new one opens in 2016 in a $92-million bridge project.</p><p>Within four years or so, Reliance hopes to convert the long-abandoned warehouses into restaurants with patios and also create a waterfront boardwalk that would be open to the public. The developer is proposing to construct a five-storey complex on Wharf Street that would hold 59 condo units aimed at higher-end buyers. 'Jon Stovell is making a dramatic statement in his foray into the Victoria market,' said Shaun McIntyre, a managing associate at Merrick Architecture, which has been hired for the Janion and Northern Junk projects. Mr. McIntyre is the project lead for Northern Junk while his colleague, Darryl Jonas, is the designer for the Janion venture. Paul Merrick is the design consultant for both Old Town properties, formerly owned by a Victoria family.</p><p>In Old Town, including Lower Johnson (or LoJo for short), Mr. McIntyre and Mr. Jonas sense a budding renaissance. Many Old Town businesses have struggled over the years, as local consumers shifted to shopping malls such as Uptown in suburban Saanich and even big-box stores in the nearby City of Langford.</p><p>Merchants in Victoria's historic core stand to benefit from an influx of residents, notably shops in Market Square and Chinatown. Another Old Town condo project getting under way is the Union development by Anthem Properties. Nearby merchants include Mountain Equipment Co-op, a Lululemon yoga-wear outlet, a variety of boutique shops and independent restaurants. Monty's Exotic Showroom Pub, a long-time strip joint on Pandora Avenue, closed two weeks ago.</p><p>Preservationists have criticized the size and scope of the new five-storey structure envisaged for what is currently public land in front of the Northern Junk site. 'People in Victoria really are quite passionate about preserving their heritage and they're very protective of Old Town,' said Steve Barber, senior heritage planner for the City of Victoria. City planners support the developer's vision for the condos, noting that some buildings were demolished in the 1960s on Wharf Street. The Northern Junk condos would fit within the historical context of Old Town, Mr. Barber argues.</p>, <p>European Central Bank president Mario Draghi has laid out a compelling case for direct intervention to keep the 17-country monetary union from unravelling and taking the euro down with it. Mr. Draghi told a closed-door session of the European Parliament that a plan devised by the ECB to buy sovereign bonds of the most fiscally distressed euro-zone members is essential to lowering their financing costs to manageable levels and restoring a semblance of stability to markets roiled by a nearly three-year-old debt crisis that has put the euro's survival at grave risk.</p><p>Proponents of a more activist role for the ECB have long argued that it must be allowed to behave more like the U.S. Federal Reserve, the Bank of England and other major central banks, whose unrestricted capacity to intervene acts as a credible check on speculators and ensures a measure of order and confidence essential to keeping capital markets functioning properly.</p><p>But since its inception, the ECB has had a much narrower mandate: to maintain price stability across the region. Indeed, before Mr. Draghi took over the helm last November, the bank insisted the long-running debt crisis could only be resolved at the political level. For the most part, under strong German influence, bank policy-makers sat on their hands while economies in Southern Europe veered off a cliff and Spanish and Italian bond yields ballooned.</p><p>But Mr. Draghi has slowly repositioned the ECB toward a more aggressive role and devised an intriguing argument for doing so. As things stand now, he told the parliamentarians in advance of a crucial bank policy meeting Thursday, plunging market confidence and widening bond yields render the bank's interest-rate weapon useless. 'We cannot pursue price stability now with a fragmented euro area because changes in interest rates affect only one country or two countries at most,' Mr. Draghi said. 'They have no importance whatsoever in the rest of the euro area.'</p><p>Germany's Bundesbank has opposed bond purchases and looser monetary policy on the grounds that such measures would boost the risks of inflation without solving the deep-seated fiscal and competitive problems at the heart of the crisis.</p><p>Mr. Draghi has offered an intriguing counter-argument: Widening yields on sovereign debt undermine the efforts of the central bank to keep interest rates low at a time when several economies have skidded back into recession. It has become impossible for the ECB to ensure price stability.</p><p>Most European leaders, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel, have come out strongly in favour of the bond-purchasing strategy, which would be done in concert with the still-to-be-approved permanent bailout fund. As the euro's future grows dimmer, it's imperative that the Draghi plan be implemented as quickly as possible.</p>, <p>In the wake of the federal budget, I find myself pondering our cultural edifices, big and small. I'm thinking about the CBC, whose funding will be cut by 'only' $115-million over the next three years. Could've been worse, some say. High time, others mutter.</p><p>This makes me worry, for some reason, about the CBC's roof, if indeed it has one. What if it needs repair? What if raccoons invade the CBC attic?</p><p>I'm also thinking about the fate of another cultural landmark, a modest A-frame cabin on the shores of Roblin Lake in Ontario's Prince Edward County, built by the great Canadian poet Al Purdy and his wife, Eurithe, in 1957. The Purdys had been living in Montreal, where the Canadian poetry scene, with Irving Layton, Louis Dudek, Milton Acorn and Leonard Cohen, was heating up. But Mr. Purdy couldn't earn a living writing poetry. (Nobody can.) He had some success writing radio plays - for the CBC, as it turns out - until that market dried up.</p><p>At 39, the writer who would become what author Dennis Lee has described as 'the finest poet English Canada has produced and one of the enduring poets of the 20th century' was impoverished and something of a failure.</p><p>So with their last $800, he and Eurithe bought a lakeside property near his hometown of Wooler, Ont. They came on a magazine story about how to build an A-frame, and ordered the instructions. Mr. Purdy didn't know one end of a hammer from the other, and the first winter they spent building the cabin was a bitter one. They used salvaged lumber, lived on what Eurithe could earn as a secretary and, on occasion, dined on roadkill stew. At first, the place featured a listing outhouse where Mr. Purdy liked to read the classics - he was a high-school dropout who had a library of more than 3,000 books. There was a windowless shed where he wrote, poking away on his manual typewriter.</p><p>It was not romantic in the least, but the move from the city to this weedy lake took Mr. Purdy back into the landscape of his ancestors, and anchored him. Here, where he wroteThe Country North of Belleville and many of his best poems, he came into his own voice, a raucous, droll, vivid, visionary inflection that is unique in Canadian writing, if not the world.</p><p>But the cabin was also party central. A trip down the 401 to the A-frame became a regular pilgrimage for writers such as Margaret Atwood, Michael Ondaatje and others who would come to define CanLit. (Mr. Purdy could also be a jerk; Ms. Atwood signed one of her books to him with the words, 'To Awful Al, from Perfect Peggy.')</p><p>Eurithe fed their weekend visitors, while her husband served them his homemade wild grape wine and provoked loud arguments over books, poetry and politics. The A-frame, built with its scavenged lumber and paint, became one of the weight-bearing beams of a young culture still under construction (a culture that, along with oil and maple syrup, has become one of our most valuable exports).</p><p>Mr. Purdy died 12 years ago. As his health began to fail, he and Eurithe spent more time on the West Coast, returning to the cabin in the summers. Now his widow is 87, and living in B.C. The time has come for someone else to care for the A-frame.</p><p>Four years ago, Vancouver editor Jean Baird launched a fundraising campaign to save the cabin and turn it into a writer's retreat. She has raised $160,000, but the project needs almost twice that. Despite the best efforts of Ms. Baird (and this is someone who successfully fought to get Canadian literature taught in B.C. high schools), no government funding agency or patron of the arts has come forward yet.</p><p>Unless someone writes a cheque, the Purdy A-frame will be sold, and perhaps torn down. The raccoons may have already moved in.</p><p>Turning this cabin into a retreat would not only honour our best poet, it would also provide the incalculable gift the Purdys extended to writers in the past - a place where the writing life is honoured, where it can thrive and evolve. And it would demonstrate that Canadians value their writers, past and future.</p><p>Do they? I'm not so sure. Would the Americans, Ms. Baird wondered in a recent interview, sell off Walden Pond?</p><p>So I worry about what will happen when the CBC's roof springs a leak, and the sensible arguments begin that the place has gone beyond repair. And I worry about the A-frame vanishing, along with all trace of Al Purdy's imprint on Roblin Lake, when it could still shelter a new generation of writers.</p><p>Marni Jackson is a Toronto journalist and author.</p>, <p>While we're delighted to celebrate this anniversary of The Globe and Mail's Canadian University Report magazine with some insightful reminiscences, our focus this year is, as always, on the current state and future of Canada's students and universities.</p><p>When it comes to marking anniversaries, publications can sometimes mire themselves in the past. Well, while we're delighted to note and celebrate the 15th anniversary of The Globe and Mail's Canadian University Report with some insightful reminiscences, our focus this year is, as always, squarely on the current state and future of Canada's students and universities. In a world where innovation, managing change and new skills and knowledge are demanded, students in the process of selecting the school that's right for them (often in concert with parents and educators), need all the most current information they can get. This will help them make a wise, forward-looking decision.</p><p>So, again this year, we're offering an exciting mix of features, plus stories that will, we hope, give future undergraduates the useful advice and helpful information that they'll need as they engage in campus life for the first time.</p><p>This year marks the fourth edition of our popular Canadian university profiles. Compiled by Emma Jones with Nelly Bouevitch, Lindsay Sample and Colleen Kimmett, these profiles of 60-plus schools have become an essential reference guide, helping students and families make what is arguably one of life's most important decisions. Like last year, in addition to the cultural and academic information contained in the profiles, we've also provided a short guide for those interested in faith-based schools.</p><p>In celebrating number 15, I'd like to thank everyone involved in this year's edition (with a special thanks to assigning editor Christina Varga). Without their efforts, and the work of those who have launched and sustained this report over the years, we'd have nothing to celebrate, so please enjoy!

Friday, a panel of five Norwegian judges found him sane and guilty of the murders, and sentenced him to 21 years in prison. It is likely that he will be detained on the grounds of dangerousness for the rest of his life. With court proceedings at an end, survivors and family members understandably expressed relief and a desire to get on with their lives.</p><p>A verdict of guilt and a prison sentence, however, were not foregone conclusions. Although there was no doubt that Mr. Breivik had committed the murders, the question of his sanity dominated the trial. Successful insanity defences are rare, especially for heinous crimes, but when insanity is claimed, it is almost always the defendant who raises the issue. Life in a psychiatric hospital seems preferable to many defendants to incarceration in a prison, and the possibility of release in the event of recovery - even if the prospect is remote - adds to the appeal.</p><p>However, Mr. Breivik's trial offered the unusual spectacle - apparently without precedent in Norway - of a defendant who insisted that he was sane, while the prosecution argued for a finding of insanity. Two teams of psychiatric experts hired by the court reached differing conclusions as to whether he had been psychotic at the time of the crime. In essence, the prosecution was attempting to have an insanity verdict imposed over the objections of the defendant, in the face of conflicting evidence about Mr. Breivik's state of mind. How do we explain this odd turn of the tables?</p><p>For legal systems like Norway's that allow findings of insanity even against the wishes of a defendant, the motivation is clear. People suffering from severe mental illnesses often deny that there is anything wrong with them and hence may reject a defence of insanity. Courts would be faced with the prospect of punishing seriously ill persons whose behaviour was driven by psychosis, rather than sending them to a psychiatric hospital for treatment. Most people share the intuition that it is unfair to punish someone who did not understand the wrongfulness of their actions, and imposing an insanity verdict avoids having to do so.</p><p>Mr. Breivik's case shows why that is a bad idea. As horrifying as was his behaviour, he had an overtly political end in mind. Concerned about what he called the 'Islamic colonization' of Europe, he sought to kill young leaders of the Norwegian Labour Party, whose policies he believed encouraged Muslim immigration, at their summer retreat on an island in a lake near Oslo. Mr. Breivik thought his actions were justified by the legal doctrine of 'necessity' to call attention to a situation that threatened the future of his country and of Europe.</p><p>To label politically motivated crimes, no matter how reprehensible, acts of insanity denies the reality of the challenge they represent to the dominant political model. No wonder that totalitarian regimes such as the former Soviet Union and China, the latter even today, prefer to impose psychiatric hospitalization on dissenters rather than respond to their dissatisfactions. Many observers thought Norway's prosecutors were seeking a similar goal in the Breivik case, trying to exclude anti-immigration sentiment from a place in political discourse.</p><p>Moreover, viewing political crimes as manifestations of mental disorders may steer society toward inappropriate responses. After all, neither the Oklahoma City federal building bombing in 1995 nor the London Underground attacks in 2005 would have been prevented by better psychiatric treatment. Appropriate responses required recognition that right-wing militia members in the United States and Islamic militants in Britain both pose risks of terrorism and need to be monitored to prevent future violence.</p><p>Unless we choose to deceive ourselves about the motives behind such shocking crimes, defendants should not be subject to imposed verdicts of insanity. Those who are too psychotic to recognize that they are ill should be considered incompetent to stand trial, and court proceedings deferred until their competence is restored. Friday's verdict in Oslo, as victims and family members concurred, brought Mr. Breivik's foray into political terrorism to its appropriate end.</p><p>Paul S. Appelbaum is Dollard Professor of Psychiatry, Medicine and Law at Columbia University in New York.</p><p>Paul S. Appelbaum, MD is the Dollard Professor of Psychiatry, Medicine, and Law at Columbia University in New York.</p>, <p>The other evening I got a robo-call. It was an automated poll. The recorded voice told me to press '1' if I approved of wind turbines, and '2' if I disapproved. I pressed '2' - hard. So have a lot of other people in Ontario.</p><p>Across the countryside outside Toronto, wind turbines are spreading like a plague. They are being built over the strenuous objections of folks who live in rural towns, whose rights have been stomped on by the province. They're chewing up birds. Worst of all, they're chewing up billions of taxpayer dollars in the name of a green dream that's nothing but a fantasy.</p><p>Premier Dalton McGuinty has heard the voters speak. In an effort to placate them, the government is going to trim its subsidies to wind and solar development and give the rural folks some say. The bad news is that these changes won't affect the contracts already in place. Taxpayers will still be on the hook for soaring energy bills for years to come.</p><p>The green energy bubble is bursting everywhere. As governments confront the worst economic conditions in decades, citizens are revolting against energy costs that have been artificially inflated by green schemes. Nor are Canadians the only people who object to the despoliation of the countryside. In Britain, where the rural landscape is considered semi-sacred, Prince Philip has reportedly denounced the wind industry as 'an absolute disgrace.' More than 100 MPs have written to the government demanding cuts to wind subsidies, which now amount to PS400-million a year.</p><p>Mr. McGuinty insists that his green energy investments will launch a vast new industry in Ontario, whose products and expertise can then be exported to the world. But the world is losing interest. Besides, green subsidies don't create jobs - they kill them. In Germany, where the government has invested heavily in renewables, high energy prices are forcing companies to close factories or move abroad. Germany has pumped more than EUR100-billion into solar subsidies, with disappointing results. Now it has announced that it will phase out support to the industry by 2017 - news that caused solar stocks to plunge around the world. Spain, which is in serious economic trouble, has also decided to stop subsidizing new alternative energy projects.</p><p>Everything Mr. McGuinty believed about alternative energy turned out to be spectacularly wrong. Today, despite billions of dollars of investment, the total percentage contributed by wind power to the global energy supply can be rounded out to zero, as wind critic Matt Ridley has pointed out. Wind power is not an efficient source of energy and never will be, because it always needs a parallel backup system for times when the wind doesn't blow. With its hulking metal towers and tons of concrete footings, it isn't even green.</p><p>Not long ago, the logic advanced by environmentalists was that dwindling supplies of cheap oil -along with breakthroughs in green technology - would soon make alternative energy look increasingly economical. Instead, vast new supplies of gas and oil - enough to keep us running for at least 100 years - are being unlocked by new hydraulic fracturing techniques. The United States has so much shale oil and gas that it could even become energy self-sufficient. The shale gas revolution is also good for the environment, because burning gas emits far less carbon dioxide than coal.</p><p>Brown energy - not green - is great for the economy. It is a massive job creator. The new energy boom will create hundreds of thousands of direct jobs, and could also kick-start a renaissance in manufacturing. A new report by PricewaterhouseCoopers for the National Association of Manufacturers says low-cost domestic natural gas will save $11-billion a year in U.S. manufacturing costs and create more than a million new jobs. To the distress of environmentalists, fracking's biggest fan is Barack Obama.</p><p>It's too bad that all this news comes too late for the people of Ontario, who'll have to foot the bill for Mr. McGuinty's green follies just as the province wrestles with horrific deficits and a bleak economy. Little old ladies on fixed incomes should pray for warm winters - and press '2.'</p>, <p>In the short space of seven weeks, a group of officials from the Western provinces will try to lay the groundwork for a new national energy strategy.</p><p>The task, on its face, appears hopeless. A national anything is hard to come by in Canada, these days, and the regions appear particularly at odds on the energy issue.</p><p>But a search for common ground is worth the effort, provided we understand what the word 'national' means. In this case, it can mean anything on which Alberta and Ontario agree.</p><p>In the wake of the National Energy Policy, the Meech and Charlottetown debacles and the wars over health-care funding, Ottawa has lost the authority to impose national standards in any area where the provinces have jurisdiction - something the Harper government well understands, which is why it never tries.</p><p>But provinces, acting together, can forge regional and sometimes even national strategies from the bottom up. There has been some limited progress, for example, in the areas of lowering interprovincial trade barriers and pooling resources in health care.</p><p>Alberta Premier Alison Redford got the other Western premiers to agree last week to seek a common strategy for harnessing and delivering energy across the country.</p><p>According to the communique, a working group will seek a proposed 'strategic, forward-thinking plan' for 'sustainable energy management and development' aimed at 'ensuring that Canada is a recognized leader' in generating and transporting energy.</p><p>The goal is for the Western premiers to have something ready to show the other premiers when they all meet in Halifax at the end of July.</p><p>Really, that seems quite impossible. Quebec and Newfoundland and Labrador are one step short of open hostilities as each develops its own hydroelectric capacity, even though it would be better if the two worked together.</p><p>In Ontario, the McGuinty government is trying to kick-start an alternative-energy industry that will both supply energy and create manufacturing jobs. (Evidence of success is noticeably lacking.) And, of course, Alberta seeks to expand oil-sands extraction and to sell that oil via new pipelines. How could any plan encompass such contradictory strategies?</p><p>Then there is the vexed question of global warming. As Michael Cleland observes, the country went from making huge commitments in the 1990s toward fighting climate change, with little thought for its carbon-based energy sector, to rampant development of that sector today, with little thought for climate change.</p><p>'I don't believe that's unbridgeable,' the executive-in-residence at the Canada West Foundation said in an interview. But the only solution may be a carbon tax, an idea the Conservatives in Ottawa have emphatically rejected.</p><p>Matthew Mendelsohn heads the Mowat Centre, an Ontario-issues think tank. He sees a country divided between an oil-wealth-generating West determined to defend its interests and an energy-consuming East that worries about growing environmental and economic inequities.</p><p>Add to that American demand, which encourages oil, natural gas and hydro to move north-south rather than east-west, and you find 'all kinds of pressures working against a national energy strategy,' he said.</p><p>And yet there is a glimmer. In Canada, 'national' rarely means something all 10 provinces and three territories agree on in concert with the federal government.</p><p>In this case, if Alberta's Ms. Redford and Ontario's Dalton McGuinty could agree on, say, how to raise money to invest in energy research, or on how to send Alberta oil east for refining in Ontario rather than west to Asia or south to the United States, or even on how to establish a price for carbon - then that agreement would carry a great deal of weight, not only with other provinces, but also with the Conservatives in Ottawa. They greatly depend on support from voters in Alberta and Ontario.</p><p>That alone is enough to make searching for a common energy strategy worth a try. At the least, Mr. McGuinty and Ms. Redford need to have a conversation.</p><p>It might come to nothing. But if it came to something, then this year's premiers meeting could prove particularly interesting.</p><p> </p>, <p>It's a conversation familiar to every parent and grandparent. Your child starts talking about what they want to be when they grow up and their hopes become your dreams. You tell them they can be anything they want. But you know, as a parent, that your child must do well in school.</p><p>A great education helps our children become whatever they want to be and prepares them for whatever they might face. It's no different for a province. In all we strive to be - a powerful economy built on strong communities, supporting a caring society - we need to do well in our schools.</p><p>In a competitive, global economy, there is no greater advantage than having highly educated people. And in an age when a single idea can quickly give rise to an entire industry never before imagined, we need every student sitting down at a desk this morning to gain the confidence that unlocks their true potential.</p><p>And we can do it. In Ontario, we're already on our way. When our government was elected in 2003, we made education our No. 1 priority.</p><p>We lowered class sizes in the early years. We worked with teachers to improve their training, increase their preparation time and enhance their pay. We provided more help for struggling students. We brought in full-day kindergarten - the first program of its kind in North America - and it will be in every school by September of 2014. And to better engage our high-school students, we created Specialist High Skills Majors in fields like construction, manufacturing and information and communications technology.</p><p>Student performance has been nothing short of amazing. And our teachers have been indispensable partners in this success.</p><p>Today, 70 per cent of students in Grades 3 and 6 are achieving the provincial standard (a 'B' grade). That's up 16 points from nine years ago. In 2003, only 68 per cent of students finished high school. Today, that number is 82 per cent. More students are moving into postsecondary education. Ontario's university enrolment is up 26 per cent. That's double the rate in the rest of the country. College enrolment is up 24 per cent.</p><p>Now, we're facing a new challenge. It's not unique in Canada. We have to protect our public services while eliminating our deficit.</p><p>In Ontario, we have a plan to balance the provincial budget by 2017-18. Our plan will grow the economy, create more jobs and support our schools and health care. It calls for hitting the pause button on public-sector pay - this affects all public servants, including our teachers.</p><p>We had a choice to make: a pay raise for teachers and continuing with bankable sick days that could be cashed in upon retirement, or focus education funding on the classroom. We can't do both. So, we chose the classroom.</p><p>We reached an agreement with the Ontario English Catholic Teachers Association that focuses on the classroom. They represent about a third of Ontario's teachers. We spent 300 hours negotiating. We had hoped to reach a similar agreement with all our teachers. We'd hoped they would come to the table and stay at the table. But that didn't happen. One union left after only one hour.</p><p>The agreement we did reach formed the basis for the Putting Students First Act. We brought the Legislature back two weeks early so we could get the bill passed as soon as possible.</p><p>We needed to reverse an automatic Sept. 1 rollover of teacher contracts. This rollover will increase pay and grant more bankable sick days at a cost of $473-million this year. We can't afford that. Our legislation also maintains stability in our schools by preventing any labour disruptions for the next two years. Because we can't afford that, either.</p><p>If passed, our new education law secures $2-billion in savings. This makes it possible to finish rolling out full-day kindergarten and keep class sizes down - so our students can keep improving their test scores and graduating in even greater numbers. In short, our plan continues our progress in our schools.</p><p>It's disappointing the New Democrats have chosen a pay raise for teachers instead of preserving progress in the classroom. The Progressive Conservatives, for their part, have been very clear. They would cancel full-day kindergarten. Both positions are shortsighted.</p><p>We can all see how much our world is changing. Consumers want products that are continually improving. Industry is keeping up with shifting trends. New trading partners emerge. But a high-skills, high-knowledge, innovative work force will always be in demand. So investments in classrooms always rise in value over time.</p><p>Our government will keep partnering with teachers by focusing on our shared priority: students. Together, we'll ensure that Ontario has the engaged, thoughtful citizens and the highly educated work force needed to build a bright future for our province and a stronger Canada for all.</p><p>Dalton McGuinty is Premier of Ontario.</p>\n"

      "'Global growth will be disappointing and uneven in 2016.' That was the prediction last week of Christine Lagarde, managing director of the International Monetary Fund.Alas, Ms. Lagarde quite likely underestimated how disappointing and uneven world growth will be in 2016, to say nothing of Canada's very dispiriting economic prospects., Tony Keller is Globe and Mail editorial page editor.If poll after poll is to be believed, Jim Prentice is about to pull off an historic first: He is about to become the first Alberta Progressive Conservative premier to lose an election since the Early Paleolithic era. The reasons are many and have been widely discussed: His predecessors left him far more than the allotted limit of political carry-on baggage. His sensible budget of mild spending cuts and slightly higher taxes - but not on corporations - succeeded in galvanizing opposition on both sides of the spectrum. His supposed masterstroke of luring the bulk of the Wildrose official opposition over to the government benches similarly infuriated many Albertans. And after 44 years of PC power, a lot of voters are suddenly ready for change - any change.Mr. Prentice has also been hit for calling an early election. What hasn't been talked about is something even more fatal to the Conservatives: a snap election has meant a short election. Very short. And its shortness - less than a month from call to vote - is killing the Progressive Conservatives.Four weeks ago, sending voters to the polls early looked like one more work of Prentice genius. But like the Wildrose floor-crossing, it can now be seen as a fatal blunder. And not just because it overrode provincial election law. The quick, short vote left voters with more than enough time to figure out just how angry they are at the PCs - very angry, apparently - but it didn't leave much time to subject the parties receiving the protests votes, Wildrose and the NDP, to anything close to the level of scrutiny visited on the PCs.For Mr. Prentice, what was supposed to be a pleasantly brief coronation has instead turned into a painfully short trial.Contrast this with what's happening at the federal level. There's a fixed election date, in October. The election cycle is already well under way - with the miles of road between now and then giving the media and the public a chance to scrutinize not just the party in power, but also the alternatives. For example, the more Justin Trudeau and the Liberals rose in the polls over the last year, the more they were increasingly subject to the glare of media coverage and criticism. There's been time to cast a skeptical eye on the thinness of their policy proposals, time for the Conservatives and NDP to respond, and time for the Liberals to respond in turn: on Monday, Justin Trudeau announced his party's intention, if elected, to raise benefits and lower taxes for middle-class Canadians, and pay for it with higher taxes and lower benefits for the wealthiest. And we're still nearly six months from a vote.A fixed election date means a long electoral cycle, with time for ebbs and flows. If you're leading in the polls, you're likely to get hit with the bright light of greater public and media scrutiny. There's time to get past first impressions, and for voters to have second, third and fourth thoughts.But the dynamics of a short election - just 29 days from start to finish - have been nothing like that. Alberta's election turned into a referendum on the following question: 'This government will surely be re-elected. How unhappy does that make you?' Only in the last few days of the campaign has it become apparent that the PCs may not be returned. It is only just dawning on protest voters that they are not casting protest votes. They're likely electing a new government.Normally, that realization would have people pivoting to ask questions about the party on the verge of assuming power: Is the NDP ready to govern? Beyond their likeable leader Rachel Notley, who are they? Do their policies make sense? Do their numbers add up? The same questions could be asked of Wildrose: At this point, the party exists more in name than in fact, yet polls suggest is likely to form the Official Opposition.A longer election wouldn't necessarily mean that voters would change their minds. But they'd have motive and opportunity to think about it. Doubts would be raised and they'd have to be answered. But thanks to Mr. Prentice's snap election call, the cycle hasn't had time to turn. And now, just like that, his time's almost certainly up., 'Anyone is crazy who voluntarily goes on The Bachelor,' said Michelle Money (official Bachelor villainess, season 15) after she was eliminated from the show, and millions of people surely nodded in agreement. She left out an important coda, though: The only people crazier are those of us who watch it.How else to explain the continuing fascination with a reality television show in which bikini-clad women race each other in tractors on the streets of Los Angeles, and say things like, 'death is zero amount romantic'? The whole show is zero amount romantic. It is in fact the place where romance goes to die, yet I, and millions like me, continue to watch it and its spinoffs (including The Bachelorette and The Bachelor Canada. Probably I'll soon be watching The Nicobachelorette, about a smoker looking for love while she tries to quit.)I feel as I should be standing in a church basement clutching a dirty coffee cup when I say this: I am a Bachelor addict. Like most addicts, I wish I were free. Can a proper feminist also be a fan of what is surely the most retrograde show on television, which transports its stereotypes - virgin, strumpet, Jezebel - by chuckwagon from 1860? That is a knotty question, which we'll get to in a minute.But first The Bachelor, now in its 19th season, still a ratings blockbuster on Monday nights for ABC; it generates spin-offs, books, specials and enough on-screen tears to float a Disney cruise ship. If you've been watching (don't be shy, we're all blameless sinners here), you'll know that the current Bachelor is Chris Soules, a.k.a. 'Prince Farming.' Mr. Soules is a farmer from Iowa, and his heart is as full of kindness as his head is empty of thoughts. Despite this, and the fact that he lives near nothing but corn, some 30 women were willing to drink warm goat's milk and swim through mud to win his hand.That number has been winnowed to three, thanks to a feral process in which the women competed with each other over who had the most 'amazing connection' to a man they'd known for six weeks. The show, always barmy, has devolved into a journey to the lost city of crazy, with one contestant attempting to leverage her recent widowhood into a trip to the altar. This week, the final three contestants will each accompany the Bachelor to the 'Fantasy Suite,' which is a bit like a product-testing lab, except for sexual compatibility rather than choking hazards.If this strikes you as having the freshness of a Blondie cartoon, that's part of the appeal. In the world of The Bachelor it is still 1962, and women with eyelashes like albatross wings fight with other women over the only thing that matters: an engagement ring. It's hugely comforting, or disturbing, depending on how you view the modern world.Seen another way, though, The Bachelor and its sister shows are wonderfully subversive. For one thing, there is almost never a 'happily ever after.' Once the scripts have been put away and the last rose has wilted, the lovers almost invariably break up. Only a handful of the show's couples, who had once pledged their troth over a product-placement diamond, actually end up together. It's an arrow straight through the heart of the pernicious romantic myth of 'the one.' There is the one, but then there's that other one, with the glossier hair.Can I be a good feminist and love The Bachelor, stripped of its cultural meaning, and just enjoy it as a show? Do I have to worry about the performative nature of femininity, or can I just marvel at the number of ways to spell Kaitlyn?Or perhaps I can just accept that I am a bad feminist, as Roxane Gay writes in her excellent book with that title. Her argument is that questionable taste in music or TV or books doesn't make a person any less politically aware or capable, it just makes her human. She can enjoy hip hop, or even The Bachelor, and not let the sisterhood down. 'I have certain interests and personality traits and opinions that may not fall in line with mainstream feminism,' Ms. Gay writes, 'but I am still a feminist.'If this were a show trial (or a reality show trial, in my case) we'd all be judged ideologically impure. And that's okay. We can spend the day kicking against the pricks, and nights wondering who gets a rose., The hardest battle in our fight to save our native children is against ennui. If you haven't encountered that word before, it means something about a ton heavier and a lot deadlier than simple boredom. It means a lifelong sort of tiredness. It means lassitude, an unrelenting feeling of nothingness. It means you give up trying, dreaming or seeing yourself doing something better.I encountered it head on recently. I was at a northern reserve to deliver a workshop called Empowering Community Through Story. It was designed to allow native youth to gather and tell stories about themselves and their community in a variety of different media. The program offered the chance to use art, photography, video and oral and written story to create a comprehensive image of their home. It would have allowed them to see and share how they viewed their reserve in the past, present and future.Because I believe so much in the healing power of story, I created the program so that native youth would discover that stories can be told in any number of ways. I designed it so they could choose how they wanted to tell them. I aimed it right at technology and art. If I had the relevant experience, I would have used dance, theatre and music to achieve the same goals. It was a grand initiative with incredible potential for change and empowerment.Not a single youth registered. It was a free program with no registration fee. It wasn't really their fault, because no one on the reserve got the word out. There were no posters or anything, so that when we arrived, no one was expecting us. There wasn't a single person from administration, community development or health and wellness to show us where to go. We were a special program with no participants. So months of creating and planning went down the drain and we had to create something out of nothing.When word did get out that we were there, reserve families simply sent their young children to us so that we could act as a sort of casual daycare. The program wasn't designed for tots or those under 15, so it collapsed and became something far different. It became a face-to-face encounter with ennui.The youngsters wanted stimulation. That was the good news. So we created an art program on the fly and got them painting, making collage and decorating hula hoops. But their level of interest and ability to concentrate and focus flagged very quickly and every art session devolved into noise and mayhem after about 30 minutes.When I tried to get the community to show up at free lunches so I could take photographs for a community album, no one showed. When we attempted to get the health workers to arrange interviews with elders for a video that would go in their museum, no one showed - except when they knew they would be paid. Everything we tried to accomplish for that community fell flat. In the end, we created a small but vibrant community photo collage, and a short video with three elders talking and telling stories. But it was only through our energy. The community itself never showed.When we left, there was no one there to receive the projects. There was no one interested enough to come see what we had created for them even though we'd been there for 10 days. Our bright, shiny projects that showed such hope and promise were left with no one to view them. It was sad - heartbreaking, even, because that's what's at the core of dysfunctional and ineffective reserve communities. Ennui. A thousand-pound word that means you simply just don't care any more.It's the system that brings a people to that. It's the Indian Act. It's an imposed welfare mentality. It's generation after generation of crushing isolation and poverty. It's the deeply ingrained belief that there is nothing else possible and that no one sees us or cares about us anyway. It's the entire history of Canada and her relationship with native people focused despairingly on our most vulnerable.It's killing us, starting with our youngest. It's foisted upon our youngsters and our youth and robs them of vision. Those kids in that art class didn't lose their focus because they weren't interested. They lost it because in the larger picture of their lives it had no place. It would end as all things end. It would flare as all promises flare and then gradually slip away never to be repeated.Ennui. The acceptance that this is all there is and all there ever will be. Fighting that is where our greatest battle has yet to be fought.Richard Wagamese is an author and journalist from the Ojibway Wabasseemoong First Nation. His most recent book is the novel Indian Horse., Sarah Kendzior is a St. Louis, Mo.-based commentator who writes about politics, the economy and media.As Aleppo fell, as children were slaughtered, as women chose suicide instead of rape, and as terrified Syrians said their last goodbyes, Sputnik - a Russian state propaganda outlet - issued a bulletin:'#Aleppo atrocities: the mainstream media's latest psyop #SyriaCrisis #FakeNews'There is nothing fake about the atrocities of Aleppo. It is arguably the most well-documented war in history, with four years of brutality and bloodshed meticulously tracked daily. A cheap phrase - 'fake news' - is used to throw documentation of suffering into doubt.More from Sarah KendziorDonald Trump's shakedown of the American dreamA fascist's win, America's moral loss'Fake news' is a term that entered the vernacular following the election of Donald Trump. Allegedly coined to bemoan the terrible reporting that helped facilitate Mr. Trump's rise, it actually serves to stabilize his rule. 'Fake news' poses a false binary, blurring the distinction between political propaganda, intentional disinformation, attention-seeking click-bait, conspiracy theories, and sloppy reporting.When the United States elects a man who peddles falsehoods, obfuscates critical information about his business transactions and foreign relationships, and relies on both mass media outlets and untraditional venues like conspiracy websites to maintain his power, the manifold ways he lies are as important as the lies themselves.According to reporter Daniel Dale, Mr. Trump told at least 560 lies during the course of his campaign. Some lies are audacious in that they are easily disproven - for example, when Mr. Trump claimed he did not tell U.S. citizens to 'check out a sex tape' after tweeting to them to do so. Flagrant lying is a hallmark of despotism. It sends the message that one should not bother speaking truth to power when power is the only truth. It implies that the teller of the lie defines reality, no matter what evidence there is to the contrary, including the liar's own words.However, Mr. Trump's most powerful lies contain a grain of truth that plays to the preconceptions of his audience. When Mr. Trump lies about the conditions of inner cities, about the economy, or about Hillary Clinton, he exploits the vulnerability of some citizens while telling others what they want to hear. These lies are propaganda: false information with a political purpose, tailored to incite.But instead of both parsing the meaning of Mr. Trump's propaganda or searching for the critical information he refuses to disclose, much of the U.S. media has leaped on the term 'fake news' as an easy explanation for why Mr. Trump triumphed. 'Fake news' co-exists with 'post-fact world': an odd phrase to invoke when describing a candidate known for threatening journalists, forcing employees to sign non-disclosure agreements, and using libel lawsuits to intimidate critics.If 'there's no such thing as facts' - as one of Mr. Trump's surrogates proclaimed - why does Mr. Trump's team work so hard to suppress them?But as inauguration looms, Mr. Trump's team may not have to work too hard to keep the U.S. press in line. U.S. journalists, always his greatest ally due to corporate collaboration and fear of retaliation, are already mainstreaming the Trump administration's most inflammatory ideas. To read the U.S. media today is to see a CNN debate on whether Jews are people, the Associated Press falsely tweet that the KKK has disavowed white supremacy, and countless mainstream media puff pieces on neo-Nazis that focus more on their fashion sense than their fascist beliefs.With hate crimes soaring, it is unnerving to see the media glamorizing or excusing extremist views. But that is where the term 'fake news' controversy becomes useful for them. An outlet criticizing fake news implies that its own news is true news. To bemoan a 'fake news' crisis bolsters one's own legitimacy, which is a dangerous thing to do when you are writing glossy profiles of people who endorse ethnic cleansing. Such coverage abets Mr. Trump's goal, which was always to pull the fringes to the centre, making the extreme mainstream.U.S. citizens are facing a twofold assault on truth: one, of propaganda intended to change standards of what is considered normal; and two, of instilling a nihilistic helplessness in those aware of the propaganda deluge. 'LOL nothing matters' has become the catchphrase used by those peddling flagrant lies.But do not be fooled by cynical claims that 'nothing matters.' When people are suffering, it matters. When lies enable that suffering, exposing them matters. Truth is always worth fighting for. But to get to the heart of the truth, you must examine the nature of the lie., These are no longer the days of Lester Pearson, when peacekeeping was a matter of watching a quiet ceasefire line or supervising a recognized international border.Most peacekeeping now is about trying to minimize bloodshed and create pockets of order in the midst of grim, intractable civil wars.But in the 2015 election, the Liberals were eager for Canada to return to the glory days of Pearsonian peacekeeping, the better to strike a contrast with the Conservatives. So promise peacekeeping they did.Harjit Sajjan, the Minister of Defence, is a former soldier who served several multiple tours in a war - Afghanistan. He is no naif. But he is taking very seriously the government's desire to 'support United Nations peace operations,' and he is hinting that he will make 'certain visits' on the ground, to find a mission for Canada to take part in. There is a sense that the Liberal government is searching for an international trouble spot into which it can send Canadian soldiers - sorry, peacekeepers - thereby satisfying the psychological needs of many voters.Peacekeeping missions under consideration include Mali, the Central African Republic and Colombia.The long, horrendous civil war in Colombia may actually be winding down. But the proposed African missions could prove to be no easier than Canada's difficult, deadly experience in Afghanistan.Mali is an extremely dangerous country, where at least 53 peacekeepers have died. The Central African Republic has been similarly chaotic for years. This is the region where the distinguished Canadian civil servant Robert Fowler came very close to death.Mr. Sajjan and Foreign Minister Stephane Dion should think long and hard about what Canada can realistically do, and how much Canadian blood risks being spilled in the doing, before sending soldiers into harm's way in the most difficult parts of Africa., It's not exactly breaking news that women walk a fine line when it comes to how much and what kind of emotion we present in public - and, if it helps, I am smiling while I type this. But not this. Now I am not smiling. Now I am serious, but I'm not being a drag.I am just serious in a way that says 'I'm ready to listen. Now would be a good time for you to talk.'Now I am smiling again, but just enough to let any sensitive onlookers know that I'm not angry with them. Or anyone. I have never actually been angry with anyone, ever, in my whole life. I did not want that parking space anyway.I'm well aware that anger in a woman is viewed less as a motivating force of legitimate origin, something that really might fire a girl up to do great things, and more as a pre-existing condition based upon which a woman can be denied credibility-coverage at any point down the line.Try asking people to say two simple phrases out loud. Have them say 'He's really angry' and then 'She's really angry.'Almost invariably the intonation will be entirely different for these two lines.'He's really angry' will generally be said in a deep monotone, as in: 'He's really angry. Attention must be paid.''She's really angry' will usually be said as if some highly unfortunate diagnosis were being made.'She's really angry,' people will say, sometimes shaking their heads. It's said as though, somehow, through her own poor decision-making skills, our hypothetical angry woman has succumbed to some kind of ghastly and fatal skin disease.'She's really angry...' they will say.'Oh, no!' the listener will instinctively cry. 'How long does she have left?'It's not surprising that most women learn pretty early not to drift too far over to either side of the emotional prime meridian that has been mapped out for us.Stray to the passionate side of that line, perhaps lured away from the straight and narrow by an excellent joke, an idiot boss or enthusiasm for one's job, and we're judged to be 'too emotional' to be relied upon, possibly even 'angry.' Which, as everyone knows, demands a complete quarantine.Cautiously chart a course toward the other - sombre - side and you're unlikely to be celebrated as 'dispassionate,' 'reserved' or 'stoic.'You'll just be a 'stone, cold bitch' or 'too remote to be relatable.' if you're being discussed on a panel show.This standard is how we got to commentator after commentator insisting that Americans viewed former First Lady, senator and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton as some kind of chick-Hal 9000 capable of only 'I'm sorry, Vladimir, I can't do that.'Which may not be just what America needs, to be honest.What Ms. Clinton really had to do during the debates, it was advised, was not lay out her vision for America, trade on her wealth of experience, answer yet more questions regarding her use of a private e-mail server or even just tear down her opponent, but 'prove she is human.'Honestly, the e-mail thing should have been evidence enough. Not really understanding how one's e-mail works should clinch it for anyone. It's as if, reliability-wise, Hillary Clinton had a beer with 90 per cent of the American people.Karl Rove and a number of George W. Bush White House staffers used private domains to send and receive a massive number of e-mails, as many as 22 million of which may have disappeared into the e-ether, and yet these fellows are seldom hung in effigy by raging crowds in repurposed sports stadiums.Cries of 'Lock Karl up! Lock Karl up!' do not echo through Democratic Party rallies. There are, however, now cries of 'Lock her up! Lock her Up!' when Donald Trump angrily (but that anger should be taken as an indication of just how deeply wronged he has been, not as proof of deep-seated emotional instability) mentions any of the women (I won't even bother giving a number, what with this still being a few hours from going to press) who have accused him of sexual assault and/or harassment.Feel free to take that as an indication of what those cries of 'Lock her up!' are really about.For the record, were I speaking in public, I would, at this juncture, laugh a little bit, noiselessly, I promise. Think Mary Pickford, if that helps.I would do that just to confirm that I am still not angry with anyone in the room. I have never been angry with anyone in a room, or on a patio, or on a boat, or in the '18 items or less line' stuck behind someone with severe dyscalculia and all the coupons.Yes, I would laugh at this point, but not so much as to give the impression that I'm not taking every single person in the world seriously, no matter what the hell they are going on about.Then I would smile like everyone was watching - because I am a woman in public and so there's a good chance they are watching. They are watching my teeth, which are getting dry under these lights, and it's just possible I will, upon occasion, take my pleasantness a touch too far.'Not smiling enough. Not smiling enough. Not smiling enough! Oh noooooo! Smiling too much! Throw that thing out.'Smiling, for women, is the avocado of facial expressions.It's all about trying to hit the smiling sweet spot us ladies, I say, smiling, but only slightly.For the love of God, don't cry. If you ever feel yourself tearing up a touch while discussing months of hard work on behalf of your nation being flushed down the drain by Wallonia, look around for a convenient distraction.Is there by chance a small, adorable, helpless puppy in the room? Good. Pick it up and throw it out the window. This will likely play better in the press than you sniffling a little in public.You wouldn't want to give the opposition any ammunition, now, would you? Hurl the puppy, ladies. Given a choice, always hurl the puppy.I think our Minister of International Trade, Chrystia Freeland, learned that last week when she wisely, as it seems to have turned out, and convincingly announced that, as far as the long-sought and elusive Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement was concerned, Canada was taking its puck and going home.'Since the trade minister is incapable or unwilling to do her job and ratify this vital trade deal, will the Prime Minister grab some adult supervision, get on a plane, and go back over to Brussels and get this job done?' Conservative MP Gerry Ritz demanded to know.Note that Mr. Ritz was fully prepared to credit Justin Trudeau - arguably the most big-L Liberal of Liberals, a Liberal squared, in fact, a man the Conservatives like to attack as being just 'a drama teacher' with 'nice hair' - with having what it takes to get CETA sorted, something they sure as hell failed to do.A Harvard- and Oxford-educated Rhodes Scholar who happened to mist up a bit, on the other hand, just had to be in way over her pretty little head.Mr. Ritz was that anxious to infantilize the minister, that sure his dig would be well received. He saw an opening - women don't get much of a window; we're either babies or crones - and he took it.All the little girls in Canada heard you, Mr. Ritz, and you know what they're doing? They're smiling.That should make us all sad, Mr. Ritz, and maybe angry, and we'll all be better off when all the girls are just laughing at you., For six minutes last Wednesday, a beaming Marine Le Pen held court on France's main nighttime TV newscast - a platform once off limits to her kind - to explain why the previous day's populist earthquake in the United States would jolt her own country's presidential race.'If the people have reserved so many surprises for the elites lately, it's because the elites are completely disconnected,' the leader of France's far-right National Front said after Donald Trump's victory. 'We can render possible that which had been presented as impossible.'Ms. Le Pen has been denigrating every consensus of the French elite - on immigration, on free trade, on religion and on Europe - since long before Mr. Trump began his crusade for the White House by insulting every American establishment that moves. But it may have taken Mr. Trump's election for French elites to start taking her seriously. Suddenly, what seemed ridiculously impossible seems increasingly plausible.Related: Trump's victory a win for Europe's populist parties as election cycle loomsAnalysis: Sarkozy and the French fear factorOpinion: Why France's Hollande is losing his grip'The main lesson for us is that Marine Le Pen can win in France,' former centre-right prime minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin said after the U.S. election. 'Extreme populism can win.'The thesis that June's Brexit vote generated, and Mr. Trump's election validated, Ms. Le Pen could prove in the French presidential vote. 'Madame Frexit' had been expected to come first in April's opening round of the vote, only to succumb to an anti-Le Pen wave in a two-candidate presidential run-off election two weeks later. Her defeat no longer seems so bankable.Much of the outcome will depend on who else is on the ballot. The main centre-right opposition party - which just changed its name to Les Republicains in part to shake off its establishment image - will elect its presidential standard-bearer in a two-round primary starting on Sunday. The favourites, Alain Juppe and Nicolas Sarkozy, are polar opposites, meaning the dynamics of the presidential race will be very different depending on which of the two wins the primary.Mr. Juppe, a former prime minister, leads the opinion polls for both the primary and the presidential race. After the surprise Trump win, no one knows whether to believe them though, especially since no one knows who will turn out to vote in the primary. Most agree, however, that Mr. Trump's victory gives a shot in the arm to Mr. Sarkozy's flagging candidacy.Mr. Sarkozy, the hyperactive former president booted out of office in 2012, is running, improbably, as an outsider. He attacks the elites nearly as much as Ms. Le Pen does and peddles an anti-immigration message nearly as xenophobic as her anti-Islam diatribes. Unlike Ms. Le Pen, however, he wants only to renegotiate France's European treaties, not rip them up.Also unlike Ms. Le Pen, who vocally backed Mr. Trump from the start, Mr. Sarkozy spent most of 2016 dismissing the bombastic billionaire. 'I find it terrifying that 30 per cent of Americans can identify with that,' Mr. Sarkozy said as Mr. Trump rang up consecutive Republican Party primary wins earlier this year. This week, however, he was praising American voters for validating his own anti-elite drive to return control over France's borders to the French people.Mr. Juppe warned, in contrast, that the U.S. vote underscored 'the risks of demagoguery and extremism' and called on French voters to take heed. His down-the-centre pitch for national unity is hauntingly similar to the fateful 'Stronger Together' slogan of Hillary Clinton's campaign. He is as beige as Ms. Clinton, with plenty of scandals on his rap sheet. And he has the backing of the French establishment to boot.Could that spell doom against a populist politician as fiery as Ms. Le Pen? Could Mr. Sarkozy's base of small-business people and notaries opt for Ms. Le Pen if he's not on the ballot? Could left-wing voters, who have splintered among several competing factions in the face of Socialist President Francois Hollande's unpopularity, unite behind Mr. Juppe to stop Ms. Le Pen? Who knows?For all their similarities, the differences between the French and U.S. electoral systems make Ms. Le Pen's climb steeper. The French elect their president through direct suffrage, not an electoral college, and the winner needs to capture more than 50 per cent of the vote. And French turnout is robust, with 80 per cent of eligible voters typically casting a ballot in presidential races, compared with less than 60 per cent of registered U.S. voters.Still, with Brexit looming and Trumpism rising, only an ostrich would count Ms. Le Pen out., Stephen Harper should lose sleep this week, as the Danish-owned Nordic Orion becomes the first cargo vessel to use the Northwest Passage as an international shipping route - at no little risk to Canada's environment and sovereignty.Last week, the crash of a Coast Guard helicopter in the Northwest Passage underlined how very dangerous Arctic waters can be. The three men on board were wearing survival suits. They escaped the aircraft before it sank but froze to death in the hour it took for the icebreaker Amundsen to reach them.Although the Nordic Orion is ice-strengthened, Arctic storms, shallow waters and icebergs still pose risks. Small chunks of icebergs called 'growlers' are extremely hard, float low in the water, and are difficult to spot. In 2007, the ice-strengthened MS Explorer sank during an Antarctic voyage after striking a growler. Then there is 'icing', which occurs when ocean spray freezes onto the superstructure of a ship, causing it to become top-heavy and capsize.Canada's Arctic search-and-rescue capabilities are desperately poor. Our long-range helicopters are based in British Columbia, Nova Scotia and Labrador: each aircraft would take more than a day to fly the 2,500 kilometers to the Northwest Passage, stopping to refuel along the way.C-130 Hercules planes can be sent from southern Canada, but unlike helicopters, cannot hoist people on board. Worse yet, the Hercules used for search and rescue are nearly half a century old and often un-deployable for maintenance reasons. An attempt to procure replacements began in 2002, but eleven years later, no construction contract has been signed.As a point of comparison, Russia has several search-and-rescue stations in the Arctic and is building ten more - each with its own ships and aircraft.Canada lacks a single port along the Northwest Passage in which a vessel could seek refuge in the event of mechanical problems or a serious storm. Russia has sixteen deep-water ports along its Arctic coastline.It is time to implement the long-standing plan to transform a disused wharf on Baffin Island into an all-year naval base. And to build other ports, perhaps at the communities of Tuktoyaktuk and Iqaluit, where they could serve double duty.A major investment in charting is required. In 2010, John Falkingham told the Nunatsiaq News that inadequate charts are the 'single biggest issue in the Arctic.' Mr. Falkingham, who spent three decades in the Canadian Ice Service, explained that only one-tenth of Canada's Arctic waters are charted to modern standards.In 1996, an ice-strengthened cruise ship went aground on a sand bar near Gjoa Haven, Nunavut. In 2010, another cruise ship ran onto an underwater ledge near Kugluktuk, Nunavut.Then there are the environmental risks. The coal being carried by the Nordic Orion would not cause much damage in the event of an accident. But the fuel oil on board the vessel certainly would. In 2004, a Malaysian cargo ship lost power during a storm off the south coast of Alaska. The vessel was blown aground and broke apart, spilling 1.2 million litres of fuel oil. Almost none of the oil was recovered due to the remote location, bad weather, and the near-complete absence of oil spill clean-up equipment and personnel.Russia is prepared for these situations, with dozens of powerful icebreakers that it uses to escort foreign cargo ships. Canada's Coast Guard icebreakers are growing old, and most are too small and underpowered for convoy duty. There are plans for only one new vessel, but again, no construction contract has been signed. The Navy has no ice-capable ships whatsoever, and the planned Arctic/Offshore Patrol Vessels have fallen years behind schedule.The Nordic Orion will not undermine Canada's legal position that the Northwest Passage constitutes internal waters, since the ship has registered its voyage with the Canadian Coast Guard - thereby seeking and receiving permission from Canada. But other ships will follow, and their compliance with Canada's domestic laws - and therefore our ability to ensure safety and environmental protection - cannot be assumed.The best way to promote Canada's legal position is to provide infrastructure and essential services. International shipping companies will register their voyages if doing so will ensure their access to icebreaking, world-class search and rescue, weather and ice forecasting, and ports of refuge.It is also time to seize the diplomatic initiative - and discuss the Northwest Passage with the United States, which has to be worried about the possibility that smugglers, illegal immigrants and even terrorists might use the Northwest Passage to access North America. Some Americans have already realized that these challenges are best addressed through a coastal state's domestic laws, rather than the much weaker powers available under international law in a so-called 'international strait'.Is Canada a serious Arctic country? Are we a responsible coastal state? Are we a reliable ally of the United States? These are the questions the Prime Minister should ask himself, as he lies awake this week.Michael Byers holds the Canada Research Chair in Global Politics and International Law at the University of British Columbia. He is the author of International Law and the Arctic, recently published by Cambridge University Press., It's so very easy to defend the freedom of speech of those we agree with. It requires no particular courage or intellectual rigour. And so all those who are critical of newspapers, like this one, that have chosen not to publish the more inflammatory cartoons of the French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo are having a terrific little time right now. They have nothing on the line as they gleefully accuse the media of heinous shortcomings in the emotional aftermath of the murders of most of Charlie Hebdo's senior editorial masthead.Newspapers and TV stations - and, somehow by extension, their reporters - are called cowardly because they won't print or broadcast images they consider offensive. They are labelled appeasers on the grounds they are buckling under to rioters in the Islamic world who protest the publication of images considered blasphemous. 'Terrorism works,' say the critics who believe the sole reason an outlet would refuse to publish an offensive Charlie Hebdo cartoon is out of fear of retaliation.How incredibly easy. How crass and pompous.There are 12 people dead in Paris, murdered because the editors and cartoonists at Charlie Hebdo stuck to their editorial guns. They printed what was their right to print, even though many wished they didn't. The government of France at one point tried to get them to tone down their provocations. But after the offices of Charlie Hebdo were firebombed by Islamist extremists in 2011, the government gave the magazine police protection. The government supported the right of Charlie Hebdo to publish what it wanted, even though it disagreed with the content. That was courage. That took intelligence.What doesn't require courage or intelligence is demanding proof of one's solidarity with the victims of the Paris massacre by reprinting their most offensive material. The right of Charlie Hebdo, and all the Charlie Hebdos of the world, to publish provocative, offensive, satirical cartoons must be backed without reservation. But so too must the right of other publications to make different choices - namely to defend Charlie Hebdo without embracing and endorsing everything the satirical newspaper ever did, or holding its work up as canon.The Globe and Mail, along with The New York Times, the CBC and many other media outlets, last week chose not to reprint Charlie Hebdo's deliberately provocative cartoons. We made the same decision in 2006 after a Danish magazine was threatened by extremists for publishing cartoons depicting Mohammed as a terrorist. Both decisions were made in accordance with the newspaper's beliefs and values. Charlie Hebdo's editors lived by their values, and died for them. If there is a better way to honour them than by doing the same thing, we don't know what it is., He was supposed to be the guy who would be measured with his words, the one who had to stay above the fray.Stephen Harper's use of the expression 'old-stock Canadians' added an odd twist to Thursday's leaders' debate, clouding his attempts at being statesman-like.Detractors talked about dog whistling. Supporters Googled past occasions when Liberals said the same thing. And people whose forebears didn't land in Canada until the 20th century just felt awkward or annoyed.'Old stock' is not a common utterance in current Canadian public discourse, but veterans of Quebec's tumultuous politics of the 1990s will remember the words and the debate - that is how the expression 'Quebecois de souche' was usually translated into English.Quebec politicians struggled to find acceptable ways to describe the descendants of the French-speaking pioneers of the 17th century. As inclusive as they tried to be, the separatist leaders could not avoid talking about the newcomers and the others because much of the debate stemmed from Quebec's distinctive history and demographics.Jacques Parizeau, no fan of political correctness, felt that there was nothing wrong with pointing out statistical realities, such as the fact that non-francophones wouldn't vote for his party.We know how badly that ended, one night in the fall of 1995, when he was supposed to calm the crowd but instead gave way to his anger.Liberals at the time were not immune to racial gaffes either.I have written in the past about how, that same year, while I was chatting with the columnist Chantal Hebert at a reception in Ottawa, then-prime minister, Jean Chretien, walked by and asked, with a grin: 'Are you trying to solve China's problems?'There was no ill will on his part. Though obviously, since Chantal isn't Chinese, he didn't see me foremost as a member of the press corps, but someone with yellow skin.It depends on the context, of course. Any newcomer knows that when they are asked 'Where are you from?' the question could either be queried out of friendly curiosity or uttered with animosity and resentment.Look for example at the time Justin Trudeau also used the expression 'old stock.'It was in 2007, in an interview with the community weekly Nouvelles Parc-Extension News, where he explained that he opposed Mr. Harper's motion to recognize that 'the Quebecois' form a nation. He asked if everyone in Quebec was part of that nation or whether it was just for the 'old stock.'His words were controversial at the time because he opposed the motion, not because of the way he described a segment of the Quebec population. Those who weren't 'old stock' didn't mind it, since he was speaking up for them.Was Mr. Harper deliberately sending a message?Or, even if it was an off-the-cuff choice of words, was it a slip that revealed the speaker's hidden fear of the Other?It certainly reminded some viewers that they were the Other. Their anger was genuine, not a pearl-clutching act. 'I couldn't even sleep last night I was so pissed [off],' one friend, a Canadian of Jamaican origin, said.Mr. Harper's controversial remark came after he was asked about denying health care for refugees.'The only time we've removed it is where we have clearly bogus refugee claimants who have been refused and turned down. We do not offer them a better health care plan than the ordinary Canadian can receive,' he said.'I think that's something that most new and existing and, and, old-stock Canadians agree with.'Lost in the controversy is the fact that Mr. Harper's comment about health-care coverage was inaccurate. The cut affected not only rejected refugee claimants but also claimants from what the government designates as 'safe countries.'One can hear, watching that video clip again, that Mr. Harper hesitates and searches for words: '... and, and, old-stock Canadians.' But the essence of it was that Mr. Harper was trying to say that even newcomers would agree with him.That was always the way the Conservatives made their pitch to minority voters - by drawing a line between the law-abiding ones, whose social values also happened to be conservative, and the others, those who were portrayed as queue-jumping terrorist-sympathizing bogus asylum seekers.It was about us and the others, even if the line wasn't meant to be drawn along racial lines.But the reaction was predictable because the Conservatives had been pressing that button before. By trying to ban the niqab from citizenship ceremonies while fundraising on the issue. By raising fears about terrorism. By retaining Lynton Crosby, an operative associated with emotionally-charged campaigning tactics in Australia and Britain.They had played that game before, and those who already didn't like the Conservatives weren't going to give them the benefit of the doubt., A lot of Canadians are worried about whether someone like Donald Trump could become prime minister. Given that political trends can cross borders as easily as acid rain, it's not impossible. Kellie Leitch sure is giving it the old college try. But the rise of Mr. Trump is only half the story of America's sudden political upheaval. The other half is the collapse of Hillary Clinton.If I were Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, I'd be carefully considering what made Ms. Clinton toxic for so many voters. A lot of it was about the economy. Much of it was out of her control. But some of it was her own handiwork. Exhibit A: Her fundraising, and that of the Clinton Foundation, the latter featuring foreign donors and vague but suspicious connections running from government to the foundation and back again.Opinion: Like Trudeau, Liberal MPs just want fundraising controversy to endGlobe editorial: Justin Trudeau's latest cash-for-access explanation is worse than the lastRelated: Justin Trudeau says he uses cash-for-access fundraisers to champion the middle classThe parallels with recent revelations about Mr. Trudeau and his party are hard to miss. Donors writing cheques in return for face-time with senior politicians? Check. The appearance of conflict of interest? Check. A foundation bearing Mr. Trudeau's name, with relationships to his family and his government, raising money from foreign donors? Check. And all of it legal? Almost certainly, and almost certainly irrelevant.The amounts of cash involved are far smaller in Canada than in the United States because our political fundraising laws really are stricter than those down south. That's been one of Mr. Trudeau's defences and he's not entirely wrong. But regardless of the amounts, the principles at stake are the same, as are the dangers for the Prime Minister. For a political leader, public trust is the oxygen of elected life. You can't survive without it.A lot of U.S. voters came to believe Ms. Clinton represented corruption in politics. The charge was hugely overblown, and relative to Mr. Trump, who loudly celebrates his conflicts of interest, it was absurd. But it had something to it and it stuck.Mr. Trudeau can take steps to eliminate the possibility of voters buying such a charge, or he can let the material with which to build a case mount up.To eliminate the problem, the PM would have to do two things. First, change the rules around political fundraising, removing the temptation to sell political access. And second, remove himself, his family and the Government of Canada from the operations of the Trudeau Foundation. Make the perception of conflict of interest impossible by eliminating the possibility of actual conflict.Thanks to former prime ministers Jean Chretien and Stephen Harper, unions and corporations are already banned from donating to federal politicians, and individuals are limited to a combined total contribution to parties and candidates of just over $3,000 a year. But that's still a lot of money, which is why access can still be sold. Dropping the maximum donation to just $100 would fix that. It would put cash-for-access out of business.Then there's the Pierre Elliott Trudeau Foundation. Because the former PM's son is now the current PM - not something anticipated back in 2001 - the foundation's unorthodox, public-private partnership structure raises the potential for conflicts of interest. The only victim of any public perception of a conflict would be the Prime Minister himself.The foundation was created by Mr. Chretien, who gave it $125-million of taxpayer money. But the Trudeau family were given an ongoing say in its governance, including seats on the board. (Mr. Trudeau stepped aside several years ago; his brother remains.) The Industry Ministry, whose minister serves at the PM's pleasure, also nominates board members. And the foundation, despite its wealth, seeks private donations. Earlier this year, two Chinese businessmen donated $200,000; one of them, who has met with Mr. Trudeau, is president of the China Cultural Industry Association, which is overseen by China's government. Is this illegal? No. But it looks terrible. And fixing it would be easy.To avoid even the perception of conflict of interest, Mr. Trudeau can announce that the foundation will have no connection to him, his family or his government. That means no family or government appointees. Make it clear that the foundation's work is entirely about the former PM's legacy - and has no connection to the current PM., In the early 1990s, a psychologist named Robert Plomin began a wide-ranging study whose results are upending everything we thought we knew about the roots of human behaviour. He began to study twins. He wasn't the first in the field, but today he is the most influential.Twins come in two types: identical, which means they share all their genes; and fraternal, which means they share no more genes than any other siblings. They present a natural experiment in why people differ, and the influences of nurture versus nature. Bottom line: Genetics is important everywhere we look - not just in height and hair colour but also in behaviour. 'A good general guess is that genetics explains 50 per cent of the differences in people in terms of personality, vocational interest, depression,' Dr. Plomin says. 'That's a huge amount of explanatory power.'Today, spectacular advances in molecular genetics are producing an explosion of new information about how our genome shapes us. Harvard psychologist Steven Pinker predicts that these findings will fundamentally reshape our understanding of human nature. They may also reshape our thinking on everything from parenting and education to broader social policy.No doubt you've read those stories about identical twins who were separated at birth but grew up to be uncannily alike. My favourite is the story of Jack Yufe and Oskar Stohr, separated when they were six months old. Jack, raised in Trinidad as a Jew, later joined Israel's navy as an officer. Oscar, who grew up in Nazi Germany, was Catholic and a member of the Hitler Youth.But the similarities were even more striking than their differences. Both were hot-tempered, impatient and demanding. They preferred to read books back to front. They flushed toilets before and after using them. Both had dreams about killing the other in war. When they met in later life, both showed up wearing white sports jackets and wire-rimmed glasses.Here's just some of what the new genetic science has shown:* Serious disorders once thought to be wholly psychological in origin are now known to be organic. Autism was thought to be a developmental disorder caused by bad parenting. Schizophrenia was blamed on 'refrigerator mothers.' Now we know from twin studies that both autism and schizophrenia have a strong genetic component, as do learning disabilities.* The effects of family socialization on your children's personalities, as Brian Boutwell and Razib Khan write in Quillette, 'are not large, not prominent and not pronounced.' What you do (or don't do) to your kids has no influence on their innate intelligence, their temperament and personality traits, or their interests. Spank or don't spank, read to them or not - it really doesn't matter. You can, of course, make a difference if you save up all your money to send your kid to Harvard, or try to teach your antisocial miscreant anger-management techniques. But you can't change who they are. Your greatest influence on their lives was the moment you rolled the dice and bequeathed your and your partner's genes to them.*Intelligence (as Dr. Plomin and others wrote in an influential piece in Nature) is 'one of the best predictors of important life outcomes such as education, occupation, mental and physical health and illness, and mortality.' Intelligence, one of the most heritable behavioural traits, is also an important factor in class differences. Intelligent people are healthier, happier and stay married longer. They are also likely to marry each other and produce intelligent children. The implications for inequality and social mobility are significant.It's easy to see why this stuff is so explosive. It sounds so fatalistic! The idea of innate differences is anathema to many people who value equality. If genes are so important, what happens to our efforts to create social justice? What happens to our notions of social reform progress? There's also the grim spectre of the past. Genetic determinism has been linked with some of the vilest chapters in recent history.No wonder many people - especially social scientists, feminists, and progressive politicians - think behavioural genetics is a Pandora's box that should be slammed shut as soon as possible. They remain heavily invested in cultural determinism - the idea that your environment, not your origins, makes you who you are, and also that the right social policies can significantly change the outcomes.But genetic denialism has its own risks. One risk is that by not acknowledging the importance of heritability, a lot of social science research is misleading and useless. And many of the policies it has inspired won't work.Today the social sciences face a deepening crisis of legitimacy - largely because social scientists, who are overwhelmingly liberal, can't bring themselves to acknowledge what's staring them in the face. Yet good social policy depends on it. Dr. Plomin believes this is especially true in education, which should be both more effective and more humane. 'It does poor service to social change to subordinate truth to politics,' he says.With the revolutionary new techniques that have been developed for exploring the human genome, the cascade of findings in behavioural genetics will be increasingly difficult to ignore. They'll be controversial, but also liberating. Meanwhile, you can focus on the good news: Whatever's wrong with your kids is probably not your fault., If Canada's other national sport is feeling superior to Americans, then 2016 is the game's golden age. Watching Donald Trump carry his sideshow to the centre stage of U.S. politics is making us all feel more than a bit smug. Because of course something like that could never, ever happen here. A Canadian Trump? Impossible.Don't be so sure. A year and a half ago, most American pundits, not to mention the grandees of the Republican Party, felt the same. They expected Mr. Trump to be quickly and safely returned to his day job in reality television.But the forces that powered Mr. Trump to the GOP nomination, and that still give him a shot at the presidency, are not uniquely American. His campaign is appealing to voters who believe that the people in power, including the people running the party they've traditionally supported, not only do not care about them, but don't even speak their language. They feel that political correctness has shut down their ability to express what's bugging them. They feel that their country no longer belongs to them culturally and no longer benefits them economically.Trump's true believers: How he's gone farther than Europe's far right, and who got him thereThrough the looking glass: the many faces of Trump and his fansFair or not, these kinds of frustrations are, to some extent, common among large parts of the population in every Western democracy - though who and what they're mad at, and why, varies. Canada's economy and history are different enough from the United States that a clone of Mr. Trump couldn't get elected here: How many people are going to vote for a guy pitching a border wall to cure an illegal immigration problem that Canada doesn't have? But someone Trump-like who attaches himself to more relevant grievances, real or imagined, will have a shot.Because of slavery, Jim Crow and desegregation, race and racial fears have long been at the heart of U.S. politics. In recent years, the country's economic changes have fallen hardest on white, blue-collar men, creating a perfect combination of real economic difficulties married to imaginary racial causes. That's why Mr. Trump's promise to keep out illegal immigrants, rip up trade agreements and thereby somehow bring back manufacturing jobs, appeals to so many. He may not have answers, but he is naming what many voters see as their problems.Canada has a very different history. The spectre of race doesn't hang over it. And immigration is far less controversial here because it is orderly, with immigrants chosen abroad, rather than showing up unannounced. As for illegal immigration, we have very little.That's why a Canadian Trump probably would not mine racial paranoia. But that still leaves lots of resentments and frustrations - economic and cultural - waiting to be harnessed.Just look at what happened in the last federal election, when the Conservatives decided to double down on plans to ban the niqab at citizenship ceremonies. The gambit may not have saved Stephen Harper from electoral defeat, but the party had polling that suggested its proposal was popular. It was never about shutting down or even reducing immigration. But it was an attempt to shine a light of disapproval on one very small group of people - as a way of signalling to many other voters that, under the Tories, immigrants would adapt to Canadian culture, not the other way around.Or consider Toronto's late mayor Rob Ford. He came into office on a campaign that was in many ways Trumpian, but without the racism. If anything, Mr. Ford transcended race. He was most popular in the horseshoe of poorer suburbs around the wealthier centre of the city, including neighbourhoods with few people of his complexion. He ran against the alleged downtown elites, the lefties and pinkos at City Hall who were supposedly wasting everyone else's money on their own private gravy train.Mr. Ford said he could cut taxes while building 'subways, subways, subways,' which is kind of like promising to remain stone-cold sober while chugging Dom Perignon. Pledging to improve public transit for his long-suffering constituents, while cutting the transit budget, did not add up. But his appeal was never about the details of his platform. He was selling empathy for shared resentments, not carefully mapped out solutions.His connection to voters was visceral and cultural. And the medium - Mr. Ford himself - was the message. So it goes with Mr. Trump. So it will go with the next Canadian politician who figures out the formula and follows in their footsteps., Gordon Gibson is the author of A New Look at Canadian Indian Policy. ggibson@bc-home.comThe Prime Ministerial nose must be twitching, the spine tingling, dampened finger held in the air the better to test the winds. Is this the time? Arguably, we are at a textbook moment for the calling of a snap election.This is one of the highest risk/reward chances a First Minister can take. Pauline Marois did it and lost, big time. Kathleen Wynne did it and won, though her hand was forced. My old boss, Pierre Trudeau, did it in 1968 and overwhelmingly swept the country.Ironically in this moment the stage has been set by Justin Trudeau. His remarks over the deployment of jet fighters to Iraq have revealed again a streak of youthful foolishness and adventurism that we saw in the severing of wise old Senators from his caucus (who would surely advised against this latest folly had they still been in the room) and the wholly unnecessary rousing and partisan cloaking of the abortion issue. The public and even the editorial page of this newspaper are openly wondering about his judgment.This could hardly be better for Mr. Harper, who is facing a tough electoral quandry. People are rather tired of him, and looking for somebody new and younger. (The Prime Minister is only 55 but has been around for a long time. He has whatever is the ageist component of gravitats.)The voting intention numbers in the polls have been stubbornly stuck for months at about 40 for the Libs, 30 for the Conservatives, 20 for the NDs and 10 for the odds and ends. Those figures spell the end of a Conservative government if crystallized in an election. And it will obviously take something big to move the numbers. The moment may have arrived.The issue of Canada joining the likes of the United States, Britain, France, Australia, the Netherlands and some Arab countries in an aerial assault on the forces of the barbarous Islamic State is a big one. Mr. Harper properly called a Parliamentary vote on it, though by convention he didn't have to. Perhaps he was setting a trap? After all he didn't brief the opposition privately on his reasons, which is the right thing to do in such cases. He just put it to them, which caused Mr. Trudeau to take much offence. But sometimes better to sit there and take it.Instead he walked into a trap. He caused his party to vote against joining the coalition, even for a very limited time with minimalist exposure of soldiers and military assets. This at a time when, according to one public poll, a full 64 per cent of Canadians want this done. This was a foolish number to ignore, but he did it. Liberal grandees such as former foreign minister Lloyd Axworthy and former leader Bob Rae are appalled. Senior MP Irwin Cotler very pointedly abstained on the vote. The Liberals are currently on the wrong side of history, as most see it.It takes 36 days to hold a national election. Yes, according to the law it is scheduled to happen only a year from now, but that law has a loophole big enough to flip a CF-18 through. Now, think about how that election might unfold if called now.The election themes to be set by Mr. Harper, if he could make it stick, is 'Our troops must know the people back them no matter what the Liberals and New Democrats say! Fight the most deadly and disgusting and dangerous force in the world which has suddenly appeared in Syria and Iraq and must be stopped!' and, 'Canada does not leave it for others to do the heavy lifting. That is not the Canadian way.'The days and weeks pass by. The jet fighters are slowly deployed to the Middle East, no casualties yet, a few sorties flown. IS atrocities grow more horrific by the day and their ground troops are not rolled back. The resolve of the allies strengthens. All of this dominates the media. (Oh,...all except for new and plausible budget and tax-cut promises in the Fall Economic Statement.)Poor Mr. Muclcair, who surely must be one of the most frustrated politicians ever in the country given his high hopes and hard work, would run about the country promising a better left wing world and secretly hoping to hold on to a more pacifist Quebec.Mr. Trudeau would be left with flashing his sunny smile and explaining how a non-kinetic (as the soldiers say) activity like humanitarian aid is really the best way to fight this menace, and besides, have I told you the rest of my program?This particular Canada-in-the-world concern has the legs to dominate a campaign of just a few weeks. This looks like Mr. Harper's best shot unless he has some very secret platform plans that might compare. Will he roll the dice?, Steven Fletcher, the Conservative MP from Winnipeg, has done Canada a service. In March, he introduced two private member's bills to allow physician-assisted suicide. His bills rekindled the embers of a national debate. If they ever reach the Commons for a vote, attention will again be focused on an issue that refuses to go away.Mr. Fletcher has a personal authenticity on the subject, not that he wishes assisted suicide for himself. He knows suffering, having become a quadriplegic after a terrible accident. Bravely, he ran for Parliament and was elected. Bravely, he now presents these bills, knowing that they will not find favour at the highest reaches of his party, nor with a majority of his caucus colleagues.The first bill would define how consent by individuals would be given to assisted suicide and exculpate physicians for their assistance. The second would create a commission on physician-assisted death. It would provide information to the general public and to individuals and families wishing to pursue physician-assisted death.Canada has been around the issue of physician-assisted suicide many times in the past two decades. There have been legislative initiatives and there have been court cases (including at the Supreme Court of Canada), but we have never arrived at a consensus to allow the practice, as some European countries have done.Quebec's recent legislative initiative came closest to success. A bill introduced by the Parti Quebecois government would have allowed physician-assisted suicide with a range of appropriate safeguards and checks involving patients, physicians and families.The PQ lost the election, but the bill had garnered widespread political support. It is entirely possible that the new Liberal government might reintroduce the bill, or something close to it. With a legislative majority and obvious support from at least the PQ (and perhaps the other two parties), the Quebec Liberals could take the Canadian legislative lead. (The federal Liberals endorsed decriminalization of physician-assisted suicide at their last convention, but it's too soon to tell whether the party will include the idea in its election platform.)Doctors' associations appear split on assisted suicide, judging from polling and resolutions debated and voted upon in general assemblies of physicians. There certainly is no consensus among the medical professions. It's not an easy moral and professional question for many doctors, who understandably wish the issue would just go away. But it won't.As Canada's population ages, more people will be stricken with incurable diseases, from which will flow questions about what is called the 'right to die.' There is no such 'right' in the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, but there is a 'right' to 'security of the person,' which, under a certain construction, could be used to make assisted suicide a legal right.We shall see whether the Supreme Court, which once turned down assisted suicide in the Rodriguez case, is prepared to reconsider. A case from British Columbia (Carter et al v. Canada) is headed to a Supreme Court with different judges in place and more time to have taken stock of public attitudes.As with the legalization of marijuana, assisted suicide is slowly gaining ground in the United States, where several states have policies. Legal challenges to permit the practice are moving forward in other states.A few other countries, including the Netherlands, Belgium and Switzerland, have laws governing euthanasia or assisted suicide - laws that have often been cited by those pressing for change in Canada. It should be noted that the number of people using these laws is a tiny fraction of the total deaths each year. Assisted suicides have been few in number. The notion that there are massive numbers of people choosing to use this avenue is misguided.With all appropriate safeguards in place, as they are in jurisdictions where the practice is legal, assisted suicide is a humane addition to individual rights and the dignity of the person. Is it controversial? Yes. Should it be debated again? Yes. It cannot be ignored., If this week were a menu item at Tim Hortons, it would have to be called 'the crispy hot mess sandwich.' There it was, our secular church, our carbohydrate campground, caught in the cruel pincers of fate - or, if you prefer a metaphor more pertinent to its dilemma, mired in tar sands. I like to think of it as a tempest in a Tims cup.It should have been a good week for Tims. Wednesday was devoted to its admirable project of sending underprivileged kids to summer camp. Friday was National Doughnut Day and while the holiest day in the fried-pastry calendar has its roots in the United States, it has celebrants in Canada as well.Unfortunately, the sacrament of the Timbit was interrupted by a schism that rocked the church. A group of activists took umbrage at glossy Enbridge ads extolling the wonders of fossil fuel, which Tims customers could choose to watch (or not) as they waited for their neon confectionary. Some 28,000 people signed a petition asking Tims to remove the ads from their restaurants - or else. 'A public outcry will let Timmies know that it can't get away with shilling tar sands without us coming together to stop it,' the petition read. Bowing to this pressure, Tim Hortons agreed to stop running the Enbridge ads.Quite wonderfully, at least for lovers of farce, Canada's conservatives decided that they had found a cause worth fighting for; Tims was the hill they would die on. It was D-Day all over again, except here 'd' would stand for double-glazed, or possibly double-double.As Buzzfeed Canada revealed, it was conservative political strategist Stephen Taylor who hyped the hashtag #BoycottTims on Twitter, enlisting the high-profile support of three ministers of the government, Pierre Poilievre, Michelle Rempel and Jason Kenney. It was actually a bit of a relief to see them speak out; in the deafening silence following the Truth and Reconciliation Commission report, I was a bit worried that all Tory ministers were felled by some wasting disease and lost their voices. But once a truly important matter arose in public debate, they made themselves heard; it was a Tims miracle.The coffee-crushing juggernaut did not end there. Other powerful fans of the oil sands and the Alberta energy sector vowed they would also take snit leave, and not darken Tims' doors again. Rebel Media's Ezra Levant organized a Boycott Tims rally in Calgary, which appeared to draw more journalists than protesters; Brian Jean, the Leader of Alberta's Wildrose Party, channelled the spirit of Thomas Paine: 'I'll pick up my Tims coffee again when they decide to apologize for taking jabs at our industry, which is so important to Albertans.'It may not have occurred to the organizers of the Tims boycott that it could very well backfire. A certain number of Canadians will find Tim Hortons infinitely more welcoming if they are unlikely to encounter Mr. Levant or Conservative cabinet members there. In fact, Tims could adapt this as an advertising slogan, in the way that some candy manufacturers lure allergy-alert parents with the promise '100 per cent nut-free.'The Boycott Tims movement now has a petition of its own, which is quite sweet. It is raising money to buy radio ads, and perhaps those ads will warn of the dangers of marijuana use and national child care, thus killing a bunch of birds with one stone. Most valiantly, it is recommending alternatives to Tims, including Starbucks. This cannot be easy, for everyone knows that crossing Starbucks's threshold increases the likelihood of turning a regular joe-drinking Joe into a latte-lover, with its commitment risks of listening to the CBC and reading Margaret Atwood. Careful, fellas, is all I would say. It's a foamy slope out there.The land of boycotts is a crowded one - so crowded, in fact, that there is an app called Buycott that you can swipe over a barcode to determine just how morally soiled or pristine a particular product is. The Ethical Consumer website lists dozens of ongoing boycotts, against everything from Air France to Coca-Cola to the country of Botswana, for a variety of transgressions against animal rights, labour rights, equality rights and more. I honestly have no idea how the site's curators will fit the Tims boycott into that list. My feeling is that they will stare at it for a while, shake their heads and mutter: 'Canada. What the hell.'As well, boycotts are a notoriously useless gimmick, unless the target is large, plain and evil (e.g. South Africa's apartheid regime). I'm not sure the obscure corner where Canadian culture, politics and snacking meet will fit those criteria.A quick glance at my local Tims revealed that it was as packed as ever. The chatty elderly colonized one corner, as they always do until the manager hustles them out the door at night and locks it quickly behind them. There were hooky-playing teens and exhausted new parents and happy new Canadians. The church will survive. When the wafers are this good, why go elsewhere?, There's a good chance you returned to an old flame over the holidays, figures suggest. But was something awakened in you?I'm referring, of course, to Star Wars: The Force Awakens - a force in the universe so strong that it drew people back to that old love, the movie theatre, after years of neglect. This week it became the highest-grossing film of all time in North America.Many of you have probably been involved in a new, comfortable situation - holed up under the covers at home with Netflix (and perhaps BitTorrent, shame on you). In 2014, attendance at North American movie theatres hit a nearly two-decade low. Things are expected to bounce back somewhat this year; The Force Awakens is obviously a factor.The film presented an enormous opportunity. Here was a chance for theatres to woo back audiences, by showing them what they've been missing. Think midnight mass: You've got a once-a-year audience packed into the pews and you want to be welcoming and impressive enough that they'll consider returning on some regular Sunday.So this reunion with the theatre for Star Wars should have been an easy and spectacular encounter. Perhaps you discovered that it wasn't.You may have wondered what the heck D-Box 3-D UltraAVX Atmos was, and why it cost $23.50 per ticket - or how it differed from UltraAVX 3-D, regular 3-D, or just 'regular.' Perhaps you balked, as I did, at the $46.38 spent on popcorn and sugary drinks - a total that did not seem to reflect the fact that you ordered family members to share, and even applied your Scene Card discount.That's when you, who have not been to the theatre in some time, were introduced to the fresh hell of the self-serve beverage machine. (Depending on your location.) You may have been surprised, after lining up for popcorn, when the person behind the counter handed over paper cups that were, alas, empty and directed you and your brood over to yet another line-up.There you performed a balancing act - popcorn, children, movie tickets - while you searched for space on the inadequately sized counter and selected from infinite flavour offerings on a touch screen that may have thrilled your seven-year-old, but probably provoked a different reaction in you, the thirsty adult breaking out into a sweat as the queue behind you grew ever longer.There are some aspects of the movie-theatre experience that are beyond the theatre's control: the bathroom stall spoilers (it happened to us), the play-by-play plot-breakdown whispers from the couple behind you, the last-bit-of-pop slurpers at key emotional moments, the Tommy Texters.But 15 minutes (approx.) of commercials? After living through those inane interactive quizzes? Followed by a similarly long block of trailers? While I did thoroughly enjoy a mock trailer for Chicken Squad - an ad from the B.C. Chicken Marketing Board - one line from it seemed to sum up the endurance test of this movie-going experience: 'Oh, cluck.'It seems to me if they want to lure audiences back to the theatres and away from their couches and all the binge-watching they can manage for $9.99 a month, exhibitors are going to have to do better. Otherwise it's just too easy to stay home and watch Making a Murderer or 134 episodes of The Good Wife.A film diet consumed entirely at home is a viable option, with a film and TV landscape that is pretty much unrecognizable from the previous time a Star Wars movie whisked us to a galaxy far, far away.On iTunes, you can already order recent blockbusters such as The Martian or Mad Max: Fury Road - both of which are up for Best Picture awards at this weekend's Golden Globes and are likely to score Oscar nominations when they're announced on Thursday.In 2015, Netflix subscribers watched 42.5 billion hours of programming. This week, Netflix announced a huge global expansion into more than 130 new countries (with the notable exception of China - and they're working on that). 'You are witnessing the birth of a global TV network,' said chief executive officer Reed Hastings.That birth comes with all kinds of potential carnage. In Canada, pick-and-pay, cord-cutting (and cord-nevers - people who have never subscribed to cable and don't plan to) are of grave concern to cable and satellite providers and the television industry. A report out this week predicts funding and job losses with the great cable unbundling to come - even a threat to the survival of some Canadian channels.Sure, giant releases such as Star Wars and 3-D technology you can't get at home will always be a draw. But if it's unpleasant at the multiplex, it's pretty easy to just stay home; there's always something to watch. I love going to the movies, and I hate being a Marsha Moaner, but I fear the industry is losing the plot - and is in danger of losing the audience, too., This will be remembered as the month when Turkey's elected regime crossed the moral red line into acts of genuine totalitarianism. It is a moment to back away from our close alliance with that regime.Canada and its allies are relying on Turkey. Our military campaign in northern Iraq and Syria, to which Ottawa is contributing more than 800 trainers and special forces, would not function without the active co-operation, including access to military bases and border openings, provided by Turkey, a long-time fellow NATO member. And Turkey, which has received and is housing close to three million Syrian refugees, is seen as being vital in preventing the refugee flood into Europe from becoming less manageable - so vital that the European Union this week struck a deal in which the Turks, in exchange for reducing the refugee flow, will be given visa-free travel in Europe, billions in financing and a more direct pathway toward eventual EU membership.Turkey, however, has become a problem. A really big problem. A week ago Friday, Turkish soldiers and police surrounded the offices of Zaman, the country's largest and by some measures best newspaper, fired tear gas, broke down the doors and seized control of the paper and its media empire with authorization from courts appointed by president Recep Tayyip Erdogan and his party. By Sunday morning, the paper, known for its independent-minded columnists, was publishing the most anodyne form of government propaganda.This is bad enough in itself, but it is part of an unprecedented campaign to shut down or seize control of all forms of political, bureaucratic and media opposition - officially in the name of shutting down the Islamist and Kurdish movements. Mr. Erdogan claims they are security threats, but in practice, these crackdowns give him absolute executive power by eliminating all institutions of democratic and popular dissent.That campaign went into high gear hours late last year after Mr. Erdogan's AKP (Justice and Development Party) won a majority in the Nov. 1 national election. The editors of the important moderate news magazine Nokta were imprisoned for 'fomenting armed rebellion' - that is, for criticizing Mr. Erdogan's authoritarian approach. The most outspoken columnists in the newspaper Milliyet were fired or silenced. TV stations have been shut down.More than 1,800 people have been arrested in the past year on charges of 'insulting the president' - a law whose very existence is contradictory to democracy. Those imprisoned under it include the editor of the newspaper Birgun, who was found guilty of insulting Mr. Erdogan in an acrostic puzzle. And hundreds of government officials have been arrested or sacked on accusations that they are associated with the Islamist Gulen movement, which had brought Mr. Erdogan to power a decade and a half ago, but which he now opposes as a threat to his power.Mr. Erdogan won November's election on a fear campaign aimed at Turkey's Kurds, who make up about a fifth of the country's population. The Kurdish-Turkish violence that drove those fears is entirely the creation of Mr. Erdogan, who abandoned his long and successful unity-building efforts in 2013 after Kurdish-led moderate political parties became popular with non-Kurdish Turks seeking a modern and European-minded alternative. They therefore became threats to his goal of gaining an absolute majority he could use to rewrite the Turkish constitution and make himself president for life.Mr. Erdogan is now bombing his own citizens aggressively: The Kurdish-majority city of Diyarbakir has become a deadly place of bomb craters, house-to-house searches and seizures and late-night disappearances. Little of it has anything to do with actual threats to the Turkish state. As the British writer Christopher de Bellaigue recently observed of the Nov. 1 election: 'Erdogan pulled off the classic politician's trick of successfully selling the panacea for an ailment largely of his own making.'Kurds in Syria and Iraq are our most important allies in Syria's civil war, and are key to finding a peaceful settlement to that conflict. By turning them into enemies strictly because they threatened his own grandiose political ambitions, Mr. Erdogan has destroyed the unified and open Turkey he earlier helped to create. And he has done so using the tools not just of authoritarianism but now, by silencing the media, of totalitarianism. It is time to stop treating Turkey as an ally, but as a country that has stepped beyond the pale., In 2007, a constable with the Durham Regional Police was convicted of assaulting a female prisoner. He was suspended and demoted under the Ontario Police Services Act, but eventually returned to work. In 2011, during a routine traffic stop, he slammed a man's head into the roof of a car, struck the man repeatedly and pepper-sprayed him. Again, he was suspended and demoted.During his second demotion, he started a foot chase with a man suffering from schizophrenia who had wandered into traffic. The scared man ran into his nearby home. The officer drew his gun, kicked in the front door, knocked the man to the floor and handcuffed him. He ignored the man's mother as she desperately tried to explain that her son was mentally ill. And then for good measure, after the man had been returned to his feet, the officer threw him to the ground again.This time, finally, the officer was dismissed from the force.What in God's name does it take to fire a bad cop in this country? That question arose again last week when a Vancouver police officer was convicted of assaulting a cyclist in an incident that was caught on video. In spite of his conviction, Constable Ismail Bhabha remains on patrol pending sentencing in the fall.The video is incontrovertible. Constable Bhabha stopped Andishae Akhavan-Kharazi in March 2013 for allegedly running a red light on his bike and failing to wear a helmet. The police alleged Mr. Kharazi was unco-operative and that he needed to be detained. The video, shot by a friend of Mr. Kharazi, starts as Constable Bhabha and another officer are handcuffing their prisoner. He is passive but asking why he is being arrested. As his arms are being twisted behind him, he reflexively pulls one of them away and drops it to his side. It's nothing threatening.And yet Constable Bhabha winds up and punches his subdued prisoner in the mouth. It's a vicious blow. You can hear the thwack.So why is he still on the Vancouver force? Constable Bhabha has demonstrated he isn't up to the job. In the video, he abuses his authority and allows himself to over-react to the slightest of provocation. He is supposed to be the trained professional who keeps his head, but it is his hapless civilian prisoner who rises to the occasion and demonstrates the self-composure required for the job of being a police officer.It is, in fact, very difficult to fire a police officer in Canada. Under the Ontario Police Services Act, officers charged with a criminal offence can be suspended with pay; one who is convicted can be suspended without pay. But moving from there to termination is long and onerous - so onerous, in fact, that Alok Mukherjee, the Toronto Police Services Board chair who resigned in June, once wondered if it is even realistically possible.'Right now it is very, very hard to terminate a police officer,' Mr. Mukherjee said in 2013 after a Toronto officer gunned down a mentally unstable man on a streetcar (the officer, James Forcillo, has been charged with second-degree murder and is back at work while awaiting trial this fall). 'There are occasions where you say, 'How in God's name is this person still working here?''British Columbia has a similarly complicated termination process under its provincial Police Act. When an officer is found to have breached the act's code of conduct, a police force has to option to fire, suspend, demote or reprimand. But the act requires the police force to choose the punishment that will be the least onerous for the officer, and to focus more on remediation than punishment.Last week, Vancouver's chief of police, Adam Palmer, defended the decision to keep Constable Bhabha on patrol. 'He's a good police officer and he's highly regarded by his co-workers and a decorated officer,' he said. 'People may make a mistake on a certain day, but I don't think they should be judged for their entire career on just one thing.'No one argues with that. But it depends on what that one thing is. In 2008, an off-duty Ottawa officer who had been fired for shoplifting was reinstated by the Ontario Civilian Police Commission. An isolated instance of shoplifting is a forgivable lapse in judgment that didn't bring the Ottawa Police Service into any particular disrepute or harm a civilian.Being convicted of an unprovoked assault that is captured on video is a different matter. The only thing standing between a rogue officer and his or her well-deserved termination is provincial legislation that usurps common sense.Legislation can be changed, though. And it should be, because times have changed. We are now in the era of the citizen video, an era that has irrevocably demonstrated to the public that there are officers out there who are not up to the job, and who put civilians at risk.This minority of officers should not be protected by outdated provincial police acts anymore. For the good of all, let's make it easier to fire those who forfeit their right to serve and protect., Because Conrad Black's interview with Toronto Mayor Rob Ford has vanished from Vision TV's website, and was taken off YouTube, I feel a duty to paint a picture for those who missed it. So get a mug of hot cocoa or a glass of mulled cider, and come and sit by the fire.The interview was broadcast Monday night on a program called The Zoomer - a 'zoomer' is a 'boomer with zip' and ... oh dear, now you've spat up mulled cider on me, but never mind, my darlings, I understand.The show was scored with swelling, canned, classical music and featured a kindly, elderly Conrad Black sitting with an affectedly 'chastened' Rob Ford, to whom he offered guidance. I'd have had wardrobe put Mr. Ford in a nightshirt and cap, but it was hardly needed: To watch Mr. Black interview the mayor was like watching the world's worst Christmas special.In the years to come, when people tell tales of this interview, some will say that stories of just how seemingly sycophantic Mr. Black was have been exaggerated, so I'll say now that his interview made the queries of a good mall Santa to a child seated on his knee look like Frost/Nixon.Mr. Black has since defended himself to Carol Off on the CBC's As it Happens, saying, 'They are not really interviews. They are conversations.'I will accept 'fireside chats,' as done for Tiger Beat magazine, because when an interviewer begins a sentence with, 'If you don't mind me saying so and I'd think you'd say so yourself,' I can almost see flowers in the guest's dressing room. They are the garlands on the grave of actual journalism, something Mr. Black used to know about.And, naturally, a beaming Rob Ford didn't mind one bit, and how could he? Mr. Black essentially played the Ghost of 'Hey, Christmas Presents!' by serving up questions as sweet as treacle tart, and frequently leaping in at the end with the answers, like dollops of clotted cream.It was as though he was concerned Mr. Ford might be stumped by questions such as what the most 'offensive events - abrasions - that have been perpetrated on you or your family by the media' might be, and the like.Mr. Ford had no problem at all with this one, claiming the most offensive perpetration award would go to Daniel Dale, a fine reporter with The Toronto Star, who in May, 2012, went to view some public land behind the mayor's house that Mr. Ford was, in an unusual move, attempting to buy from the city. He has said repeatedly that Mr. Dale stood on cinder blocks, peered over his fence and took pictures of his house, in the near dark.None of these allegations - they've been investigated by the police, Mr. Ford has yet to produce the surveillance tape of this 'intrusion,' although tellingly the police have seen it, and it wasn't dark at the time (the diligent spring sun itself may be consulting a libel lawyer) - proved to be true. But this time another one was made. Mr. Dale, the mayor told a credulous Mr. Black, was 'in my backyard taking pictures. I have little kids. When a guy's taking pictures of little kids - I don't want to say that word, but you start thinking, 'What's this guy all about?' 'Now, the list of people Mr. Black has sued for libel merits its own Wiki - he has an ear for libel the way some people have an ear for music. I imagine that knowing waiters take his breakfast order and go with 'will allegedly have an egg-white omelette' when they reach the kitchen, and only then if they have three sources lined up back at the table.So, it's curious that he didn't bat an eyelash when someone right in front of him claimed that a journalist standing on public land (this is very much on the record) was instead in the mayor's yard and taking pictures of children - children the mayor has said previously were inside. (Mr. Dale certainly feels the mayor was insinuating that he is a pedophile and has served notice that he will sue if Mr. Ford doesn't apologize in a hurry.)Although not as curious as how complacent Mr. Black was at another of Mr. Ford's allegations: that Police Chief Bill Blair has investigated drug dealing, extortion and murder in Toronto (in other words done his job) only because the mayor asked him to make 'efficiencies.'But I will leave that tale for the Ghost-of-Christmas-Yet-To-Oh-Come-On! As it is, the tape of the Zoomer broadcast has vanished, which tapes can do in this town. Was his unfortunate interview with the mayor Conrad Black's crack video?, If even a fraction of the darkness that his haters say has descended upon Canada under Stephen Harper was real, then the opening line of any election victory speech by Thomas Mulcair or Justin Trudeau could only be: 'My fellow Canadians, our long national nightmare is over.'In less than a decade, during most of which Mr. Harper led a minority government, Canada has gone from a 'haven' of enlightened liberalism and goodness to a hermit kingdom run by a small-minded tyrant propagating, in the words of one excitable critic, 'know-nothing conservatism.'Just what it is about the Conservative Leader that sends reasonable people into such fits of hysteria is best examined by historians, or better yet, psychiatrists. But it surely can't be evidence, for Mr. Harper's political style is not particularly novel, nor have his reforms been that transformational.Rather, Mr. Harper cultivates his base with mostly rhetorical, and only occasionally policy-driven, validations of their beliefs and value systems. It's largely window dressing. For the most part, he governs from the centre, upholding the long Canadian tradition of middle-of-the-road pragmatism. So much so that movement conservatives who once considered him one of them feel utterly betrayed.If the Harper government seems more obsessed with spin than its predecessors, it's partly because the science of political message control and targeting has undergone a revolution in the Internet-Big Data age. Mr. Harper's government, like President Barack Obama's administration south of the border, has simply been in the right place at the right time to make the most of it.Yes, the Conservatives have made some questionable policy choices in the name of stroking their base. Killing the long-form census was one. The form had been a long-standing bugaboo among conservatives who felt the state has no business knowing the granular details of their lives. Its demise has inconvenienced some researchers, but it has hardly led to a 'subtle darkening of Canadian life.' Somehow when it comes to critiquing Mr. Harper, all perspective gets thrown out the window.Nothing infuriates the critics more - and this is where their slip shows - than his success at usurping the political tools their side once used to corner the market. He's turned the Liberals' invention of multiculturalism against them. He's wooed suburban couples with kids away from the Liberals with an array of dubiously useful family-friendly tax credits.The truth is, Mr. Harper does not play to his base any more than the NDP's Mr. Mulcair or the Liberals' Mr. Trudeau play to theirs. But because elites in the media and academe have deemed Conservative supporters a less evolved species than the progressive subclass to which they themselves belong, they are beside themselves at the loss of their own influence.Autocratic, Stephen Harper? Well, yes, like just about every other successful prime minister from John A. Macdonald to Mackenzie King to Jean Chretien. The centralization of decision making in the Prime Minister's Office is a phenomenon much bigger than Mr. Harper and it would take wholesale parliamentary, if not constitutional, reform to reverse the trend.What's fairly clear is that a Mulcair PMO would not be expected to operate in a meaningfully different manner. The NDP Leader is as much a control freak and ruthless enforcer of caucus discipline. How else do you think he has kept his neophyte MPs in Quebec from embarrassing him too much? The worry with Mr. Trudeau is that his lack of experience would allow unelected political aides or bureaucrats to wield most of the power in a Trudeau PMO. But that doesn't mean the PMO would be any less dominant in a Trudeau government.Mr. Harper may deserve to take a hit for the Senate expense scandal. The questions raised at Senator Mike Duffy's fraud trial about the conduct of Mr. Harper's closest staff in the PMO, and the Conservative Leader himself, are not flattering. But in the annals of Canadian political scandals - a fairly tame volume to begin with - this is a footnote.Most voters basically believe all politicians are self-interested maximizers and judge them on their intelligence, competence, likeability and integrity. They know they can't get everything on their wish list. It could be that, after 10 years, they'll decide they've had enough of Mr. Harper.And the hysterics won't have Harper to kick around any more., When I was a kid, the milkman came right to our back door. He brought us bright glass bottles of rich whole milk and thick sweet cream. We drank a lot of milk. Nobody had heard of skim. On weekends my dad cooked up breakfasts of eggs fried in butter, piles of bacon, delicious German sausages. For dinner, we had big chunks of fatty meat every night.That was in the 1950s. Nobody was fat, except for one lone girl at school who everybody picked on. Most kids ate like horses and were skinny as rakes.Then the experts came along and declared that all that fat was killing us. Whole milk was banished from children's diets so that they would not develop clogged arteries and heart disease in later life. To keep our cholesterol in check, we began to ration eggs and treat butter like a toxic substance. We gave up our juicy, marbled steaks and switched to pasta. Ever since the 1960s, the authorities have told us that a healthy diet is a low-fat diet.The results were not what they had hoped. Obesity rates soared, but heart disease did not subside. And now, a mountain of new evidence says the experts were all wrong. One Harvard study found that people who had consumed the most dairy fat were far less likely to develop heart disease. Researchers at Oxford University discovered that the biggest consumers of saturated fat in Europe - the French - also have the healthiest hearts. Last year, a major review in The BMJ, a leading medical journal, found that 'saturated fats are not associated' with mortality, heart disease, strokes or Type 2 diabetes. As Ian Leslie, writing in The Guardian, puts it, 'The promotion of low-fat diets was a 40-year fad, with disastrous outcomes, conceived of, authorized, and policed by nutritionists.'The modern history of nutrition science is fraught with controversy, flawed theory, faulty research, vested interests, suppression of evidence, and vicious battles between the old guard and the insurgents. They're still fighting. But it's clear that a lot of what your Food Guide says is flat-out wrong.The biggest villain of modern diets isn't fat. It's sugar and carbohydrates.As far back as 1972, a mild-mannered British nutrition scientist named John Yudkin challenged the conventional wisdom, arguing that sugar, not dietary fat, was what was making people fat and sick. His reasoning was in part grounded in history: Humans have been carnivores forever, but carbohydrates, and especially sugar, are very recent additions to the human diet.The Yudkin theory made sense, and is undergoing a revival. But in the meantime, as Mr. Leslie writes, he and his work were brutally suppressed. By then the North American dietary establishment was firmly in the grip of the fat hypothesis, which had been developed by a forceful and ambitious American nutritionist named Ancel Keys. He had all the institutional power, and he used it to trash his rivals.Dr. Keys, who died in 2004, also seems to have suppressed inconvenient evidence. In the late 1960s and early seventies, he and a research team conducted a massive investigation into the effects of diet on thousands of mental patients. One group was fed a 'heart healthy' diet low in saturated fats; the other ate a more typical American diet. The special diet did indeed reduce blood cholesterol, what the researchers called a 'favourable trend.' But the published results were incomplete. The full results were published for the first time last week in the BMJ, they tell quite a different story. Patients on the special diet, especially those over 64, had a higher mortality rate than those on the regular diet.The Keys theory is on the way to being thoroughly debunked, not least because of the investigative work of journalist Nina Teicholz (author of The Big Fat Surprise, who is persona non grata among the nutrition establishment). Yet the establishment is still deeply embedded in the status quo. Reputations and careers are at stake; plenty of leading doctors have diet empires of their own.What's so devastating about this story, as Mr. Leslie points out, is the answer it supplies to one simple question: Who made us fat? And no, it wasn't the usual villains - big-food interests, the sugar lobby - although they certainly played a role. It was the scientific authorities and the governments that believed them.So Vive la France, and pass the butter. There's no time to waste., There are many aspects to the current struggle over the future of Crimea which pose serious difficulties for an international community that would like to respond firmly. On the one hand, Vladimir Putin's charade over troops without insignia notwithstanding, this is an act of naked aggression against a sovereign state. On the other, the realistic options for forceful responses in the short term look pretty limited.But there are signs that some European leaders, who must rise to the fore if there is to be a significant non-military response, may be serious about imposing further sanctions. The initial round of sanctions against individuals could be a prelude. Serious sanctions could hurt Russia's surprisingly vulnerable economy, if really pushed hard.Notably, German Chancellor Angela Merkel has made some tough statements about pain to come, even though it might also hurt German businesses. Ms. Merkel, who grew up in the former East Germany and speaks fluent Russian, has spoken sharply to Mr. Putin about the crisis, and, presumably, harbours few illusions about what it is like to live in a vassal state occupied by Russian troops.If the previous history of talking big but often backing down is any guide, it is easy to say that Europe's leaders will lack the determination to see it through. Perhaps that will happen this time as well. However, there is an element to this crisis which makes it just possible that Europe's leaders will be prepared to accept pain in order to inflict some of it on Mr. Putin and his Russian political allies.It's about the question of European borders.One of the central elements of the post-1945 European security system that all players have accepted is that borders are sacrosanct; even ones that make little sense in ethnic or historical terms. Having endured centuries of wars, culminating in the carnage of the First and Second World Wars, a tacit agreement took hold post-1945 that borders have to be left alone, even if there are ethnic minorities in another country.This didn't happen right away, of course, but by the 1970s the idea was enshrined in various European security and co-operation documents that the post-1945 borders of the continent had to be respected, even the ones that made no sense. If ever changes were to be made, they had to be made through diplomacy only. The alternative was a return to the kind of Europe we saw pre-1945 - and no one wanted that.It was the Russians themselves who were amongst the most keen to enshrine this principle in European security affairs. Former Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev regarded it as one of his great accomplishments that the West had accepted the post-1945 borders. He was, in return, willing to sign on to various human rights provisions. (He had no intention of fulfilling these, of course, but they ultimately helped foster a network of dissidents across the former Eastern Bloc which were instrumental in bringing it down. But that's another story.)In his move into Crimea, Mr. Putin has thus directly challenged a fundamental principle which is at the very heart of the European system; you don't carve up states to satisfy the desire to reunite ethnic groups or re-establish empires. There are lots of ethnic minorities which are on one side or the other of a border that was arbitrarily decided by where various armies had got to in the spring of 1945. Are we to go back to a European system whereby states engage in military adventurism to rectify these anomalies in their favour?It may take a while for Europe's leaders, and their North American allies to respond, as it did when Slobodan Milosevic did the same in the Balkans (and the response certainly won't be military, as Russia is a different order of adversary than Serbia was), but to accept what Mr. Putin is doing with nothing more than a shrug opens the door to a return to a kind of European order that is simply not tenable.Perhaps Mr. Putin will get away with it. At the least, if he accepts diplomacy and compromise, he is likely to get guarantees that Ukraine won't join NATO, and some sort of ongoing say in the governance of a permanently neutral country - which may have been his biggest objectives all along.But, if Mr. Putin doesn't take one of the diplomatic off-ramps being laid for him as a way out of this crisis, he may be in for a surprise at just how harsh the response could be; a newly reinvigorated NATO, and ongoing sanctions. Neither would be in Russia's longer-term interests.Mr. Putin cannot be forced out of Crimea if he decides to stay. But the cost of this adventure can be made to hurt as a signal that it is a way of doing business that is not pain-free.Peter Jones is an associate professor in the Graduate School of Public and International Affairs at the University of Ottawa and an Annenberg Distinguished Visited Fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University., Two trends have snuck up on us - slower long-term economic growth and an aging society. Together, they will stress public finances and force harder decisions for governments, regardless of political stripe. They will put squarely before society the options of higher taxes and/or fewer government services, options no politician or electorate welcomes.This week, the Bank of Canada published economic growth estimates. The bank said economic growth in 2012, when all is accounted for, will be 1.9 per cent, followed by 2 per cent in 2013 and 2.7 per cent in 2014. If correct (and predictions are usually proven at least slightly wrong), that would mean an average growth rate of 2.2 per cent over these three years.Look back over the 19 years leading to 2011. According to the World Bank's numbers, Canada's economy grew at more than 2.2 per cent in 13 of those years, grew at less five of those years, and at the 2.2 per cent rate once. On average, the Canadian economy grew closer to 3 per cent than 2 per cent over that period of almost two decades.Per year, the difference between 2 and 3 per cent growth doesn't seem like much. Add it up, year after year, and the gap is telling. More important, most of the long-term forecasting suggests that for the rest of this decade, growth will be slower than what we knew before the financial recession of 2008.The effects of slower growth will be twofold. First, government revenues will grow less rapidly than before, assuming no changes in tax rates. Second, some government expenditures will increase with slower growth, especially since slower growth means stubbornly high unemployment. The double-whammy will pinch government budgets, which are already strained by deficits, except in Saskatchewan.Then, there is the aging population with fewer people in the work force to earn income for governments to tax to produce revenues for the additional costs of an aging society. The baby-boomer generation began to retire two years ago, the harbinger of what will be a lopsided population profile.Today, about 14 per cent of the population is over 65 years of age. It is estimated that in two decades, almost 25 per cent will be seniors. The ratio of those working to those out of the work force will change slowly but dramatically over time.Unless Canadians work much smarter and unless the Canadian economy becomes much more productive - both of which require, at a minimum, more investments in education and research (and reducing poverty, which is a drag on economic performance) - then aging will be a long-term drag on growth.Health-care spending for seniors, for example, will rise because there will be more of them. The best estimates suggest only an increase of 1 per cent in overall health-care spending, but that would be something of the order of $1.4-billion per year in today's dollars. Any ideas where that money might be found? Higher taxes? Reductions in spending elsewhere? Both.The extra spending is only one part of the equation. The other part is that fewer people will be in the work force to tax to pay for the higher costs. Call it an unfunded future liability.Political people are elected for four years. These trends, however, stretch far beyond one term in office. Finding political people who will explain these trends, and finding voters willing to listen to complicated explanations in a dumbed-down media world, will be supremely challenging.Maybe the long-term growth projections are too pessimistic. Maybe startling technological breakthroughs will transform economic life. Maybe governments can reinvent how they deliver services, so that Baumol's cost disease - that public-sector wage gains outstrip productivity over time - will be proven wrong.Maybe Canadians can be persuaded that they should pay a larger share of their incomes in taxes, and stop dreaming that hard decisions can be avoided by the magic potion of 'efficiency gains.' Maybe the United States, on whose economic strength Canada depends, will recover its esprit.But for now, it would appear that the already hard challenges of governing will become even harder in an age of constrained resources., Here's a slogan on sale for last-minute political shoppers: Canadian energy for Canadians!How radical would that be? Here we are in a country pleased (wrongly) to call itself an 'energy superpower,' but the best our governments and energy companies can usually manage are new ways to export energy.Yes, yes, Canada has energy surpluses. And these surpluses need to find markets elsewhere to be profitable, whether it's hydro or oil or natural gas. We can't use all we produce. We can make money sending it south or overseas. But we could use more if we thought of energy as a national asset for use first by Canadians, or at least more by Canadians.Canada's constitutional arrangements get in the way of thinking nationally. The provinces control natural resources here, unlike in other federations. Provinces think first and foremost of themselves, in particular how much money they can get for those resources, which invariably means selling them outside Canada.Ottawa generally stands mute on the sidelines. This silence has been particularly apparently during the Harper years, because the Conservative government applies strict constitutional reasoning: What is federal is federal, what is provincial is provincial. You can see this at work in health care. Ottawa will cut a cheque, but not attach strings to how the money is spent.This strict compartmentalization is a defensible constitutional position. It minimizes squabbling. It keeps Ottawa out of the provinces' hair. It cuts down on costly, sometimes open-ended federal interventions in areas of provincial jurisdiction. It prevents Ottawa from being seen by provinces as nothing more than a cash cow.But another way of thinking about Canadian federalism sees Ottawa with its 'spending power,' a power upheld by the courts, and the only government with a 'national' vision.Natural resources such as energy are provincially owned with national implications. Where we sell, to whom and for what prices, and how we exploit the resources have fiscal-policy and sometimes foreign-policy implications. Natural resources contribute to the country's standard of living, and to regional differences, which Ottawa through equalization is charged with trying to flatten.A 'Canadian energy for Canadians' approach would not see Uncle Ottawa bullying its way into provincial jurisdiction. Rather, it would invite the federal government to suggest to provinces that it stands ready to assist them financially in projects that would move Canadian energy across the country.Think about hydroelectricity. We don't have anything like a national grid in Canada. We don't even have effective regional grids, but rather bits and pieces of regional grids. We've got highways and train tracks linking the heartlands of Quebec and Ontario, but we don't have an energy corridor from surplus-producing Quebec to Ontario.By extension, we don't have the capacity (or political willingness) to move Newfoundland's future hydro surpluses to Ontario. Instead, if the next Labrador projects ever see the light of day, the power will go through the Maritimes to the United States, aided by a loan guarantee from Ottawa.The same applies for Manitoba hydro surpluses that Ontario says it does not want or need, so the surplus goes south. In the West, new surpluses of oil and gas have gone south or offshore.Three or four years ago, a group of people from environmental and business organizations, and from assorted think tanks, gathered in Winnipeg and Banff to talk about what a more national energy framework might look like. More than anything else, it was a mind-stretching exercise trying to think through how future energy and environmental policies might work together across the country.They deliberately didn't invite the federal government, because they understood such talk would offend the Conservatives. They were even reluctant in the early stages to invite provincial representatives, in case anybody believed - perish the thought - the wind was up for something called a National Energy Policy.Preliminary papers were produced and much private discussion ensued, but the effort petered out.We are left therefore with a funny country: very rich in energy of every kind but unable and unwilling to talk about it in a national context. The best and often only approach we can take is to frame discussions about how fast, and under what circumstances, we can produce it to send elsewhere., Sometimes a guy can't catch a break.'Justin. Unplugged.' read the eye-catching invitation to a Toronto fundraiser held last week. The come-on offered well-heeled professional ladies (their word, not mine) the chance to hear the 'future prime minister of Canada' address such hardball questions as, 'What's your favourite virtue?' and 'Who are your real-life heroes?'Ladies, sometimes I cringe for my sex.'To be honest, when I first saw the invite - complete with Warholian photos of Justin - I thought it was an attack ad, thought up by the Conservative Party's war room,' blogged government-relations expert Lisa Kirbie. And she's a liberal.It went downhill from there. During the event, Mr. Trudeau was asked which nation's administration, besides Canada's, he admires most. 'Not the fluffy questions some were expecting!' exclaimed Amanda Alvaro, the host. Justin's response to this brain-buster showed why he can't be trusted to go around unplugged.'You know, there's a level of admiration I actually have for China,' he said. He went on to observe that dictatorships are able to do things faster than democracies, like going green and investing in solar panels. Sensing that he was neck-deep in the swamp, he tried to recover, but it was too late. Everybody pounced on him - Conservatives, New Democrats, Tibetans. Right-wing pundits posted photos of smog-choked Chinese cities, where people die of air pollution by the thousands. An Asian-Canadian coalition formed to fight Chinese oppression held a press conference that was covered by the CBC. They demanded an apology and a meeting to describe their personal experiences of persecution. 'Can I use the word 'foolish'?' said one.In the big scheme of things, this is a nothing. But it's trouble Mr. Trudeau doesn't need. It reinforces the impression that he's the guy in short pants. He's supposed to be the master of social media, but thanks to ladies' night, he's been trending on Twitter for all the wrong reasons.Anyone who watched Question Period during the Senate scandals could see that Mr. Trudeau was totally outclassed. As the NDP's Thomas Mulcair dissected Stephen Harper's changing version of events with surgical precision, Mr. Trudeau came across as an earnest amateur. When debate time comes around again, those two will carve him up. Poor Liberals. They have the wrong leader.As Mr. Trudeau spent all weekend gamely tweeting to defend himself, Mr. Harper stroked some of the ethnic groups his party has courted with such success. He showed up in Toronto to celebrate Diwali, where he declared that India is at the centre of the government's Asian policy. He spoke at the Ukrainian Canadian Congress convention, where he got five standing ovations.Perhaps wisely, Mr. Trudeau has mostly stayed away from boring policy stuff. After all, his strongest asset is supposed to be his personality, and the next election is far away. Still, I am beginning to suspect his policy needs work too. A couple of weeks ago, he said he thinks Canada should put a price on carbon - even though the main (and only) effect would be to raise prices for consumers while making Canadian industry less competitive. Mr. Harper, meanwhile, is going to campaign on unbundling your cable fees. If Mr. Trudeau plans to fight for the middle class, maybe he should think up something else.As Ms. Kirbie blogged the other day, Justin's biggest political problem is that he looks vapid and lightweight. The trouble is, whenever he takes a stab at saying something really substantive, he winds up looking ... vapid and lightweight.That's a problem. Even when he's only talking to the ladies., Whether the irony of the change will dawn on Canadians before the October election cannot yet be known, but ideas that inspire the Harper government's 'tough on crime' agenda are now under assault in the country that spawned them, the United States.Across the U.S. political spectrum, from liberal Democrats to conservative Republicans, the kinds of policies adopted by the Harper government are being questioned or abandoned, including by some who used to favour them.Many U.S. news media reports have remarked on the change, which is particularly notable among Republican candidates for their party's presidential nomination. Not long ago, most Republicans were all for locking criminals up and throwing away the key, both literally and figuratively.No longer. Very right-wing candidates such as senators Rand Paul and Ted Cruz favour limiting mandatory minimum sentences, which the Harper government has introduced for certain offences only to see them struck down in Canadian courts.Other candidates are seeking alternatives to incarceration, preferring treatment to prison for those convicted of drug offences. The presumptive front-runner for the nomination, former Florida governor Jeb Bush, has signed on to a conservative group's call for cost-effective alternatives to prison. Former Texas Republican governor Rick Perry, another candidate, was quoted in The New York Times saying, 'A big, expensive system - one that offers no hope for second chances - is not conservative policy. Conservative policy is smart on crime.'No hope, or diminished hope, for second chances is a cornerstone for the Harper government, which has made keeping offenders longer in jail a hallmark of its 'tough on crime' policy.In recent months, it tried to pass legislation eliminating the possibility of parole for first-degree murder. Another change made criminals wait for five years to reapply instead of two if their initial request for parole was denied.Canadian courts have been paring back some Conservative initiatives, but that does not stop the Tories from dreaming up more restrictions for prisoners and harsher sentences rather than rehabilitation.Recently, the Auditor-General of Canada showed how counter-productive this approach can be. The A-G studied the government's abolition of accelerated parole review, a form of supervised early release for non-violent first-time offenders.These offenders now must wait longer before being released into the community under supervision. The results have been exactly the reverse of what the Conservatives predicted.The Conservatives claimed the change would make the community safer. Counters the Auditor-General: 'Data consistently shows that low-risk offenders who serve longer portions of their sentence in the community have more positive reintegration results.' The A-G also noted: 'It is three times more costly to hold an offender in custody than to supervise him in the community.'On both counts - reintegration and cost - the Harper government approach is a flop. But rhetorically, the idea of keeping people in prison for as long as possible, even if the results are perverse, resonates with those who believe in it.In the United States, 'tough on crime' measures of the past four decades swelled the prison population by a factor of seven. Prisons are crowded and costly. The same trends are in the early stages in Canada. As the Auditor-General noted, crime is down, but the male prison population is up, largely because offenders are serving more of their sentences in custody.Burgeoning costs in the United States - a country with a huge prison population - is one of the reasons Republicans are having second thoughts about policies they once endorsed. Even the super-conservative Koch brothers' foundation reckons the criminal justice system is not working, for society or offenders.The Harper government's 'tough on crime' policy always was more of a political slogan than anything. Almost every criminal law expert in Canada opposed the approach, for many of the reasons now being explored, albeit belatedly, by Republican voices in the United States.Crime rates for almost all major offences had been declining for many years before the Harper government's election. Still, it suited the Conservative Party's purposes to deny facts and to sharpen its appeal to those who thought a crime wave was breaking over Canada.The government scorned the federal Justice Department experts who knew the policies would fail. Instead, the Conservatives were inspired by what they thought worked politically in the United States.It might now be appropriate for Canadians to ask: Why have we adopted an approach even U.S. conservatives acknowledge is not working?, It's tough to be a high-school principal today. That's because the inmates are running the asylum.Last month Scot Bishop, the principal at Centennial Collegiate Vocational Institute in Guelph, Ont., decided to remind his students about appropriate clothing during warm weather. 'Dress cool, not skanky,' he advised them over the intercom. After that, all hell broke loose. Female students accused the principal of sexism and slut-shaming. 'The issue is not that students are wearing provocative clothing,' declared Brittany Harlick, who organized a protest. 'It's that young bodies are being sexualized and that's a felony.'The school board had a word with Mr. Bishop, who issued an apology to all he had offended.Dress codes have relaxed a bit in recent decades. Today, ripped jeans, saggy jeans, exposed bra straps, ragged short-shorts, and tights (sans skirts) are almost de rigueur. About all that's required is that the kids' clothes cover their underwear. Some things never change, though. As always, the adults' job is to set reasonable boundaries on decorum, and the students' job is to subvert them.Ever since the '60s (and no doubt long before), students have complained that school dress codes are arbitrary, demeaning, antiquated, and an outrageous violation of their freedom of expression. But now they have another weapon in their fight against adult oppression. School dress codes reinforce rape culture.'Dress codes lead to the sexualization of young women, the punishing of women for taking control of their own bodies and the blaming/shaming of women who don't dress overly-modest,' asserted a petition to the Fredericton school board, which had a heated dress-code protest last fall. 'Blaming women for the clothes they wear rather than blaming men for sexualizing women is also a big contributor to rape culture.'In other words, if a female student comes to school dressed like a street person/hooker/skank, it's your problem. Somewhere, perhaps, there is a line. But the authorities are not entitled to draw it.Last month, graduating seniors at Biglerville High School in Pennsylvania got some tips from the administration about how to dress for the awards ceremony. 'Gentlemen,' said the letter. 'PULL YOUR PANTS UP! Your underwear choices should be your own private choice and remain private.' As for the girls, it counselled, 'No bellies showing ... Please remember as you select an outfit for the awards assembly that we don't want to be looking at 'sausage rolls' as Mrs. Elliott calls them. As you get dressed remember that you can't put 10 pounds of mud in a five-pound sack.'This frank if tactless advice was greeted by torrents of outrage from critics, who called it sexist and degrading. One offended mother threatened to sue for sexual harassment. The school board quickly grovelled.Girls, of course, should not be blamed if guys leer at/hit on/get distracted by them. Guys must learn that girls deserve respect no matter how they dress. But there's something disingenuous in this debate. It is a fiction that girls dress only to please themselves, for comfort. Every former teenage girl knows that most girls dress to attract guys. And every former teenage boy knows that most guys think horny thoughts around seven times a minute. That's not rape culture. That's biology.Thanks to social media, girls in skimpy clothes are the new champions of women's rights. After the principal at Alexi Halket's Toronto school politely suggested that her crop top was inappropriate for the classroom, she took to social media and organized Crop Top Day, which went viral. 'School dress codes teach female students that their bodies are a problem and they have to cover up,' she told MTV. 'They should really be teaching acceptance and body positivity, and also human rights.'Of course, as Ms. Halket will soon discover, feminist arguments for wearing crop tops don't cut much ice in the adult world of work. But for now, she and other youthful protesters can bask in fame. 'We are clearly in a moment of social action,' two Brock University professors, Shauna Pomerantz and Rebecca Raby, wrote in this newspaper last week. 'The activist fire seems to be spreading from school to school. What does this mean for youthful politics in Canada? And what does this mean for feminism - long considered dead among younger generations, which are often labelled apathetic?'Personally, I think it means that high-school kids might all be better off in uniforms. Not that they won't find something else to protest about., Ian Buruma is professor of democracy, human rights and journalism at Bard College, and the author of Year Zero: A History of 1945.---------------------------------------Much has been written about Donald Trump's peculiar hairstyle, the kind of puffy, dyed comb-over one would associate with a downmarket nightclub manager rather than a presidential candidate. Is there really any more to be said? Actually, the question of hair in politics might not be as trivial as it seems.It is remarkable how many politicians, especially on the populist right, have sported heterodox hairdos. Silvio Berlusconi, Italy's former prime minister, used black pencil to fill in the patches not covered by his two hair transplants. The Dutch demagogue Geert Wilders dyes his Mozartian bouffant platinum blond. Boris Johnson, the Brexit rabble-rouser, now British foreign secretary, takes care to keep his straw-colored thatch in a permanent state of studied untidiness. All have scored highly with voters filled with anger and resentment about polished urban elites.Then there was the father of modern European populism, the late Dutch politician Pim Fortuyn, who had no hair at all. But his shiny, clean-shaven pate stood out as much among the neat grey coiffures of mainstream politicians as does Mr. Johnson's blond mop and Mr. Trump's gilded affair.Standing out is, of course, the point. The strange hair, or shaven head, makes the popular leader instantly recognizable. This type of branding is common among dictators. Hitler's visual image could be reduced to a greasy cowlick and a toothbrush mustache. The oddest-looking of all contemporary dictators must be North Korea's Kim Jong-un, whose clean-shaven back and sides are cultivated as a deliberate imitation of his grandfather's 1930s proletarian hairstyle.But self-parody sometimes works in democracies, too. Winston Churchill, who in many ways is Mr. Johnson's model, always made sure to carry a big cigar, even when he had no intention of smoking it. There was not much he could do about his sparse hair, but he certainly dressed differently than anyone else. Studied nonchalance, or cultivated eccentricity, was a sign of the typical aristocrat who felt no need to conform to the boring standards of middle-class correctness.The United States does not have a formal aristocracy; status is more a question of money. One of the secrets of Mr. Trump's popularity is that he flaunts his supposed great wealth. He even exaggerates it. The absurd golden chairs in his pastiche Louis XIV homes are a coarse imitation of aristocratic style. Mr. Fortuyn, on a more modest Dutch scale, and Mr. Berlusconi, on a more grandiose Italian stage, had similar tastes. People for whom this is the stuff of dreams admired them for it. Affirming the dreams of people who have little is the key to successful populism.The main thing is that these politicians are not like the dull and moderate mainstream. Even insiders have to pose as outsiders, who can stand with the common man against the political establishment. Weirdness - peculiar upper-class mannerisms, ostentatious living, outrageous jokes, deliberate crassness and mad hairstyles - is an asset.I am not sure people who rightly see Mr. Trump as a great danger to the U.S. and the world sufficiently appreciate this.Much has been made of the reasonable and moderate tone of the Democratic National Convention, compared with the snarling bombast of the Republicans' event. President Barack Obama, Vice-president Joe Biden and nominee Hillary Clinton were paragons of dignity, compared with Mr. Trump's Mussolini-like mannerisms and verbal aggression.Clinton supporters tend to attack Mr. Trump with ridicule, which can be an effective weapon. (In the 1920s, journalists such as H.L. Mencken made Christian fundamentalists in the U.S. look so foolish that they dropped out of politics for several generations.) And Mr. Trump's offensive braggadocio, his vulgar tastes and his extraordinary looks are all eminently ripe for satire. Comedians have had merciless fun at his expense. But satire and ridicule will not work to persuade people who love Mr. Trump precisely because of his weirdness. It sets him apart from the establishment they despise. Charisma does not call for restraint in words, appearance or manner. The weirder he gets, the more his supporters like him. And the more that clever comedians mock him, the more his fans will rally to his side.This is the great perversity in our age of angry populism. Reasonable arguments and political optimism can now be turned into negative qualities, the typical marks of a complacent elite, oblivious to the concerns of people who feel that the joke has been on them. Reasonable argument did not work to convince 51.9 per cent of British voters to remain part of the European Union. It may not work to keep an ignorant and dangerous buffoon - silly hairstyle and all - from becoming president of the United States.------------------------------------Project Syndicate, Reasonable people can disagree over the size of the state. Whatever its size, we want the state to be effective.Despite a lot of anti-government rhetoric, many government programs are efficient. Some, however, are not. Although readers will cast mental votes for their favourite offenders, a case can be made that the Canadian Air Transport Security Authority should be a contender for this list.CATSA is really not to blame for what it inflicts on air passengers. CATSA enforces the rules established by Transport Canada - rules that cause long lineups that would make any time-and-motion expert weep. Those lineups, the agency's bureaucracy and the Transport Canada rules would bring a smile to Osama bin Laden's lips, for his memory lives on daily in air transportation.The rules are based on a maximum risk assessment for every passenger, which is a recipe for inefficiency and, one supposes, safety from some lawsuit about 'profiling.'This maximum risk assessment explains why elderly women in wheelchairs or shuffling with canes are searched. Even their wheelchairs get patted down for explosive material, if you can believe it. Children in strollers get the full monty.People with artificial joints - generally older people - are particularly targeted. They always get the full monty, too. Speaking of those scanning machines, how to explain that the same pair of shoes will cause no trouble at one airport but set off alarms at another airport, on the same day?By way of contrast, Australia sets the machines lower, which means that many people pass easily through them. Every eighth or 10th passenger does get swabbed. In Germany, home of brilliant engineering, conveyor belts take the trays from one end to the other, whereas in Canada, it is CATSA people who do this work.Even people carrying NEXUS cards (for which they have paid and passed security tests) are searched. They can be asked to remove their shoes, enter scanning machines, get patted down.Speaking of NEXUS, both the United States and Canada do security checks on the same people, instead of recognizing each other's clearance. This means that getting a card takes six months or more. Renewing the card can mean going through the entire screening again, although this is in the process of changing.In the United States, those with the Global Entry card - the rough international equivalent to NEXUS - can now zoom through dedicated lines. Having already been certified as no threat to the state, the holder goes into a special line where no shoes and belts are removed, no laptops leave briefcases, no coats are taken off. Only cellphones are placed in the tray. The result is fast movement for thousands of travellers.Transport Canada, however, subjects NEXUS cardholders to the same scrutiny as all other passengers. When CATSA officials are asked why Canada does things that even the security-obsessed Americans don't, the reply is usually a shrug or a comment that 'These are the rules.' So they are, even though they make no sense.Someone who sits at cabinet meetings remarked that ministers often grouse about the Transport Canada/CATSA rules, because cabinet ministers fly a lot. But they do nothing, presumably because they fear that if anything bad ever happened on their watch, the government would be blamed. Canadians have apparently become so accustomed to the CATSA performance that they don't complain very much.A favourite example of the disjunction between those ministers and the real world of CATSA occurred when then-transport minister Chuck Strahl announced a forthcoming easing of some security rules. It was great news, except that simultaneously, selected passengers were being put through a new procedure in which they had to turn over their palms for swab tests in case they had recently been manufacturing bombs.The fixation with air security - even at the tertiary airports with small planes where CATSA officials dutifully carry out Transport Canada rules - represents bureaucratic overkill. Anybody who wanted to kill a lot of people could find targets with as many people as airplanes - trains, bus stations, stadiums, shopping malls.We don't subject any of these gathering places to the level of security we reserve for airlines, because of the memory of what happened in New York on Sept. 11, 2001, and episodic threats elsewhere since.We are trapped in the past, without sensible judgment or risk assessment, having built a large, new bureaucracy whose rules are designed to be as rigid as possible, thereby mocking the idea of the efficient state., Mayor John Tory summed up the conundrum facing every city trying to deal with the Uber blitzkrieg when he announced on Monday that he plans to update Toronto's taxi bylaws.'What we need is one bylaw that applies without question to everybody,' he said. 'We cannot have the Wild West, but we also cannot have a city that in some way ignores the march of technology and time.'Exactly. It's unfair that taxi drivers who have paid for their expensive municipal permits and licences are now watching cities like Toronto do little or nothing while Uber, via its popular ride-sharing app, profits from what are effectively black markets. You can't blame drivers and fleet owners for being upset - they are playing by the rules. The thing is, those rules are asinine. They limit competition, reduce supply, diminish quality and force up prices. They should have been done away with decades ago.So how do you level the playing field without ignoring the march of technology? Regulating Uber and other car-sharing services into submission would be self-defeating. Whatever bylaw ecosystem Toronto's bureaucrats come up with, the final version should look more like Uber than the outdated and indefensible cartel system that currently controls the taxi business in many cities.In Toronto, for instance, anyone can get a permit to drive a cab as long as they can pass a few minor hurdles and cough up $634. So far, so reasonable. But the number of cars is strictly controlled by the city licensing system. There may be lots of drivers, but there's an artificial shortage of cabs.That's not good for the customer or the economy, because the cab owners and dispatch companies don't have to compete. The result, among other things, can be run-down, smelly cars that have no business being in service. Or worse. In Paris, for instance, when you call for a cab, the driver immediately turns on the meter and charges you for the time it takes to come pick you up. That's indefensible, but enforceable through a cartel.The cartel system also hurts drivers. They know there is always someone coming up behind them willing to work longer hours and for less, for whoever owns the car they drive. In Toronto, if a driver manages against all odds to get a new taxicab licence, they have to pay a ridiculous $4,742 for it. Or they can buy an older, existing licence from its owner for well over $100,000.For what good reason is it so expensive to get into the business of driving a car for hire? There is no evidence - none - that Uber drivers and cars are less safe than municipally licensed ones. Uber has demonstrated that there is little public interest in defending an artificial cartel system that enriches licence-holders to the detriment of everyone else.If cities are to keep their hand in the taxi business, let it be a light touch. Require all drivers-for-hire, Uber and otherwise, to buy a modestly priced permit at City Hall. Demand a minimum amount of insurance coverage for each driver. Then get out of the way and let the market roll., Rachel Notley is one hell of a negotiator. She is also the new belle of the climate-change ball. On the eve of the federal-provincial gabfest on climate change, she delivered a big, shiny present - a plan that makes both Alberta and Canada look good. No more rogue nation! We're leaders, not laggards. We can take this to Paris with our heads held high.No wonder Prime Minister Justin Trudeau tweeted his congratulations. She came through just in time.Ms. Notley's plan is highly aspirational. It is intended to lead Alberta to a promised land that is both prosperous and green. But it won't be cheap. It imposes an extra $3-billion a year in carbon taxes, at a time when the provincial economy is sinking and job losses number in the tens of thousands. Even so, she has managed to get everyone on side - not just the environmental groups, but also the oil industry. Industry executives are positively rapturous. 'This plan will make one of the world's largest oil-producing regions a leader in addressing the climate-change challenge,' said Steve Williams, CEO of Suncor.Translation: Alberta is doing its fair share, so you can lay off now. Please approve some pipelines, and get off our case about dirty oil. The NDP Premier and the industry are on the same page.For the industry, this deal must come as a relief. Things could have been much, much worse. The industry is at the table, not shut out of the room. It now has policy certainty. (There's nothing business hates more than a fog of doubt about what some crazy government might do.)The industry is getting some good PR for a change, which it desperately needs. It even has the stamp of approval from a left-wing government.Also, not much will come out of its hide. The carbon taxes will be economy-wide, which means that consumers will bear much of the pain, in the form of higher heating costs and prices at the pump. Also, for now, Alberta's overall carbon emissions will be allowed to grow. There are no hard targets for emissions cuts - only a broad commitment that emissions will begin to fall below today's levels by 2030. The coal plants that will be shut were slated to close anyway. The new cap on dirty oil emissions is so high that the oil sands will be able to grow another 43 per cent - roughly until the year 2030.Mr. Trudeau and the other premiers are thrilled. But perhaps they shouldn't be. For all of its ambitions, Alberta's climate plan won't advance the climate goal to which Canada has already committed. In its waning days, the Harper government (oh, irony) pledged that by 2030, Canada would cut greenhouse-gas emissions by 30 per cent below 2005 levels. This is a much, much bigger promise than the one Alberta has just made. Even so, the new Environment Minister, Catherine McKenna, says that target is just a 'floor.' Which means the rest of Canada would have to come through with impossibly deep cuts to meet the target - so deep that no one can describe how it could be done.Most Canadians (including far too many politicians) believe that doing our bit for climate change wouldn't be too hard. People want to do the right thing. They imagine we could get there with slightly higher gas taxes, more efficiencies and tougher regulations for the oil patch. Unfortunately, it's not that easy. Alberta's proposed carbon tax, for example, will amount to seven cents a litre at the pump - noticeable, but certainly not enough to change people's behaviour or even pry them from their SUVs. That would require far higher taxes - maybe 10 times higher, or more. Voters wouldn't stand for it.It's simply not possible to cut emissions 30 per cent without massive economic damage - something no government will impose. The proposition becomes even more unworkable when you consider that, by 2030, Canada will have grown by an estimated four million people.Meantime, the premiers have made their views clear. They're all hot to trot to save the planet - so long as they, not Mr. Trudeau, call the shots. They want him to send them lots of lovely money to do it. That's what all federal-provincial meetings come down to in the end: Send them the money and they'll go home happy.As for what Mr. Trudeau will say at Paris, here's a guess: It will be a triumph of marketing., If you live in Toronto and haven't been paying much attention to Ontario's new premier, better start. Kathleen Wynne's campaign for new taxes or tolls to fund transit is a striking act of political leadership. Toronto's future as a thriving, mobile community depends on its success.Take a moment to absorb how bold Ms. Wynne is being here.For a generation and more, proposing road tolls to pay for transit and other transportation needs has been considered the equivalent of political suicide. No premier, mayor or other major political figure has dared to table the array of tolls and other levies that Ms. Wynne is now talking openly about.Dalton McGuinty, her predecessor, ran for the hills at the thought of angering motorists by tolling highways. Even David Miller, this city's transit-loving mayor in the 2000s, backed away from the notion of tolls in his first mayoral campaign. Now along comes Ms. Wynne. Not long after becoming Ontario's 25th premier in February, she started dropping hints about the need to find new ways to pay for transit. After all the craven ducking and weaving of the past, it seemed hard to believe. Was it just a trial balloon, or is she for real? She is.At an event at the Spadina-subway extension site last month, she said straight out that 'We need to create a new revenue stream' to pay for future transit projects. At a Toronto Region Board of Trade speech on Monday, she drove home the point, saying there was no extra money in the treasury for the massive investments required and that it was time to find new sources. Later in the week, she called reporters to her office for one-on-one interviews on the subject, telling them that people are fed up with gridlock and want action. 'Somebody has to take on the difficult politics ... and I'm going to take this on,' she told the Toronto Star.Oh, it's bold all right. Consider the odds against her. She leads a minority government and might have to face the voters any day. Both opposition leaders, Tory and NDP, are threatening to jump all over her if she persists with her campaign for transit-funding tools. So is the mayor of Toronto, whose reaction to the idea is to make a retching noise.Polls show that voters are far from convinced by her arguments. A new poll for the CivicAction group showed that while 71 per cent of residents of the Greater Toronto and Hamilton region are indeed fed up with gridlock, just 43 per cent think new sources of funding are needed for The Big Move, the $50-billion Metrolinx plan to build out the transit network. Thirty-nine per cent think existing government funds should cover the cost. Another poll this month showed that only about a third of Toronto-region residents favour new taxes and tolls for transit.Still, it's encouraging that a premier should take the transit dearth so seriously that she is willing to go this far out on a limb. And, who knows, she might succeed. Residents know that Toronto is decades behind many other major cities in building a mass-transit network. They know transit is expensive and that the money has to come from somewhere.People like a leader who takes a stand. Ms. Wynne might not enjoy the comparison, but Margaret Thatcher showed that. The new premier is passionate about this issue and it shows. She is convincing when she says that the Toronto region cannot afford more do-nothing years. Now that she has nailed her colours to the mast, voters are beginning to take notice. They might not like the message at first, but many will rally around as the debate begins in earnest and she starts to make her case.'I'm impressed with her commitment and her frankness and her honesty,' says Adam Vaughan, the downtown city councillor. He remembers what Lady Thatcher once said: 'If you want something said, ask a man; if you want something done, ask a woman.'When it comes to making progress on transit, Kathleen Wynne may be just the woman Toronto needs., John Ibbitson is a CIGI senior fellow, an award-winning writer and leading political journalist in Canada. Currently on a one-year leave from The Globe and Mail, John is researching, writing and speaking on Canadian foreign policy at CIGI while he works on a new book.Forget the Senate scandal: the Conservatives are on the brink of an even greater fiasco, one that could tarnish Stephen Harper's legacy and brand this Conservative majority government a failure. Worse, far worse, it puts APTA at risk.Forgive me: in a world filled with acronyms, I've just invented another, and it's for something that doesn't even exist yet. But APTA represents the world's best possible future, and it hinges on Canada and Germany coming to terms.Last year, this country and the European Union signed the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, or CETA. The deal is vitally important to both sides. The Harper government is determined to make Canada's vertical (Canada-U.S.) trading economy more horizontal (Canada-Europe and Canada-Pacific). CETA is the first step in that transformation.For its part, the European Union desperately needs a win after almost a decade of economic crises and other reverses.But the text of the agreement still hasn't been released, and reports on both sides of the Atlantic say ISDS is the reason. ISDS stands for 'investor-state dispute settlement.' It provides a means whereby corporations can sue governments that violate the terms of an agreement, such as CETA.Germany is being sued by a Swedish company for deciding to phase out its nuclear power plants. If the German press is to be believed, this has made German Chancellor Angela Merkel gun-shy over ISDS. Germany wants the provision taken out of CETA. Canada won't sign without it.A representative for International Trade Minister Ed Fast says reports of CETA's demise are exaggerated. But almost a year after the agreement was initialed, the text still hasn't been released, so something is clearly wrong.The Americans are watching the Canada-EU negotiations closely. They are in trade talks of their own with Europe, known as TTIP (Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership). If CETA fails, then TTIP is doomed. That would be a global tragedy.Why? Think of what happens if CETA and TTIP get signed. It would then only be a matter of ironing out details to merge the two agreements to create NATA, the North Atlantic Trade Area. Europe and the two most advanced economies in North America would exist inside a free-trade zone, one that not only eliminates tariffs, but also establishes rules for intellectual property and government procurement, and even reduces (in a preliminary way) agriculture subsidies.And even that would be mere overture. The United States and Canada are deeply immersed in TPP, the Trans Pacific Partnership, a potential trade agreement that would involve 10 other developed (Japan, Australia, New Zealand and Singapore) and emerging (Malaysia, Vietnam, Mexico, Chile, Peru and Brunei) Pacific economies.If Canada, Europe and the United States can nail down their trade agreements, then this would offer a huge incentive to finally conclude the TPP. And suddenly we would live in a world in which Europe, most of North and South America and much of the Pacific are operating under near-identical economic rules.If all sides could be convinced to, once and for all, abandon the foolish crutch of agriculture subsidies, then there would be nothing to prevent the harmonization of the European and Pacific trade agreements. We would have APTA: the Atlantic-Pacific Trade Area.That would leave the world effectively divided into three economic blocs: APTA, representing the developed and much of the developing world; the emerging powerhouses known as the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa); and Everybody Else (E2). The real questions would then be: Will India, China and Brazil join APTA or remain outside?Over time, they would almost certainly join. Brazil would want the same trading advantage that Chile and Peru would enjoy under APTA; India is already showing interest in joining the global trading economy; China would be better off inside (and trying to dominate) APTA than outside. Once China, India and Brazil are inside APTA, any government on the planet that wants to export would have to join. The globalization of trade would be complete.The stakes are even higher than they seem. Dark forces are trying to drag the world back into its violent, protectionist past: Russia is putting 70 years of peace in Europe at risk; Islamic fundamentalists would plunge the Middle East and northern Africa into a new dark age. War and famine still stalk too many lands.Against this shadow stands globalization, a universal movement to bring the world closer together by promoting the free flow of goods, people and ideas. Globalization encourages creativity, innovation, productivity and peace. It accelerates the future.Without CETA, everything is put at risk - and, as a minor side-effect, Stephen Harper suffers a potentially career-ending defeat. With CETA, everything becomes possible. It's as simple as that.Along with other CIGI experts, Mr. Ibbitson will be contributing at www.cigionline.org/blogs, where this post was originally published., On Oct. 1, Ontario doctors will see their fees cut by 1.3 per cent. This is on top of a 3.15-per-cent fee cut that was imposed in February.The province has also imposed targeted fee cuts in a number of areas such as diagnostic imaging and diabetes management, and set a cap on total billings, creating the real possibility that, come year's end, doctors will not be paid for work performed.Not to mention that, when fees are capped, doctors have to absorb the cost of additional care required because of population growth and aging.All of these clawbacks have been imposed unilaterally after the Ontario Medical Association declined an offer calling for a 2.65-per-cent cut. (The OMA's offer of a two-year wage freeze was rejected; its previous contract also featured fee rollbacks.)The Ontario government is resorting to these bully-boy tactics because it wants to cut spending. And it thinks it can get away with it because 'fat cat' doctors don't garner a lot of public sympathy.Among physicians, frustrations are boiling over, particularly that their only recourse is venting on social media. Regardless of what doctors are paid, they deserve a fair shake in labour negotiations, and not to be treated in a heavy-handed and undemocratic manner.In recent days, provincial Health Minister Eric Hoskins and Ontario Medical Association president Michael Toth have exchanged letters in The London Free Press, both cranking up the rhetoric.The OMA argues the cuts are going to affect patient care, and paints doctors as selfless defenders of beleaguered patients. The minister counters that the cuts are not affecting care, and that scaremongering is unprofessional.While this may be entertaining, it is no way to negotiate, or resolve the system's woes.Ontario currently spends $11.8-billion on physician payments, and wants to cut that by $580-million; it's pretty safe to assume access to care will be affected eventually.Rather than setting random targets for spending cuts, the real question that needs to be asked is: Are we getting value for money for the money spent on 33,600 family doctors, specialists and residents?Nobody really knows. We don't know if the services individual physicians provide are useful or cost-effective.We don't even really know how much they are paid: Unlike British Columbia, Ontario does not publish individual doctor billings, and no province calculates the real cost of expenses.What we know is that physicians have, on average, gross billings of slightly more than $328,000 (a figure that varies widely based on specialty) but, like small businesses, have to pay their operating expenses (which also vary dramatically between specialties and cities) out of those fees.Doctors do not have pensions or benefits and, with medical-school tuition fees hovering around $25,000 a year, tend to have enormous debts. And don't forget that it can take up to 12 years of training to become a specialist.While doctors earn a good income, there is little evidence they are overpaid.But that doesn't mean they are paid sensibly either. Fee-for-service payment, which is commonplace, encourages volume, not quality. The complexity of care means interdisciplinary teams are the best way to treat patients, but creating sensible teams is difficult when you negotiate contracts of different professions separately. But, most of all, we need to find a way of paying health professionals - beginning with doctors - in a manner that rewards results.These fundamental reforms are going to take time and require long, complex negotiations. They aren't going to happen in an atmosphere of distrust and punitive clawbacks.The government needs to get back to the negotiating table and hash out a deal. Several other provinces - including Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Quebec - have done so recently, in a similarly challenging fiscal environment.If negotiating doesn't work, then the province needs to agree to binding arbitration, especially because doctors do not have the legal right to strike.Playing hardball may serve the government's interests in the short term but, in the long term, it just delays the inevitable.As Warren Winkler, the former judge who prepared a conciliator's report on the dispute, noted, without fundamental system change, the government will not be able to achieve savings, and physicians will not be able to provide adequate care.That's a lose-lose, with the ultimate loser being patients., A recent survey ranking the best and worst of Canada's longest-serving prime ministers was enough to induce apoplexy among Conservative supporters: Liberal PMs occupied six of the first seven spots.At the bottom end, Tory PMs took five of the six positions. Stephen Harper finished 10th. To find a Conservative prime minister held in high esteem required going back to the 19th century's John A. Macdonald, according to a Maclean's magazine survey of 123 political specialists.Baloney! retorted Conservatives in online posts about the survey's findings. Nothing but codswallop! The so-called experts, they complained, were mainly academics who are chiefly Liberal. There was some basis for that complaint; academics Stephen Azzi and Norman Hillmer, who conducted the survey in late summer, told me that most of the respondents had indeed voted Liberal. But the responses from Conservatives who took part weren't all that different, they said. For example, Mr. Harper finished ninth among Conservative responders, only one spot better than the overall finding.Lawrence Martin: Why the Liberals risk a drop in public trustLawrence Martin: PMs and the press: Hostilities are the hallmarkRead more from public-affairs columnist Lawrence MartinWhile some may dispute these particular results, other soundings, including public opinion polls about the popularity of prime ministers, have yielded roughly similar results.Among reasons why Conservatives fare so poorly, we might consider leadership personality. In two weeks, we'll be marking the first year of Liberal PM Justin Trudeau's governance. There's been much comment about his personification of power and how the charm offensive has struck a chord with the public, compared with the approach of Mr. Harper.But rather than being an exceptional case, this is part of a pattern. Having prime ministers who are an uncomfortable fit for the people is a problem that has long plagued Tory leaders; their personas came to grate on the public. Most left office unliked, unwanted. Consider the vainglorious Arthur Meighen, or R.B. Bennett, who was derided, sometimes not unfairly, as a pompous ass. John Diefenbaker began on a high note but came to be viewed as a messianic blowhard bordering on the unhinged. Young Joe Clark was green and gawky, Brian Mulroney too slick by half, Mr. Harper needlessly malevolent.Liberal PMs, an exception being the lugubrious but successful William Lyon Mackenzie King, had personal styles that worked better. Think of Wilfrid Laurier, or Louis St. Laurent (who went by Uncle Louis) or Lester Pearson, Jean Chretien and the Trudeaus.The Maclean's survey ranked the long-serving PMs (those who held office for at least four years) as follows: 1) Mackenzie King; 2) Laurier; 3) Macdonald; 4) Pierre Trudeau; 5) Mr. Pearson; 6) St. Laurent; 7) Mr. Chretien; 8) Mr. Mulroney; 9) Robert Borden; 10) Mr. Harper; 11) Mr. Diefenbaker; 12) Alexander Mackenzie; 13) Bennett.A separate ranking was done for the 10 PMs who held office a short time. Aside from the incumbent Justin Trudeau, it's not a list one craves to be on and here again Conservatives come out on the short end: seven on the list are Tories. Of the three Liberals, Mr. Trudeau and Paul Martin are ranked highest.Beyond the question of personal appeal, scholars cite other reasons for the big Liberal-Tory divide. The sweet spot in Canadian politics is neither left nor right, but the progressive centre. And that has usually been the Liberals' natural habitat. There is, Mr. Azzi said, 'a distinctly Canadian style of leadership that involves compromise and accommodation.' Liberal PMs, an exception being Pierre Trudeau, have been better at that.Conservative PMs, in the view of Mr. Hillmer, could never get it right with Quebec the way Liberal leaders did. Mr. Mulroney was a welcome deviation; he got Quebec aboard the Tory train until his alliance with Lucien Bouchard derailed it.Liberal prime ministers benefited from the luck of timing. Laurier and St. Laurent governed in unusually prosperous times. How could they not fare better than an R.B. Bennett who served in the Great Depression?It all started so auspiciously for the Conservatives: Macdonald, our first prime minister, was a leader of compromise and accommodation. His vision was national. He set the template for the governing of the disparate country.But it was the Liberal PMs who picked up on that template more so than the Tories. Both from a personal and policy point of view, they've melded more comfortably into our mainstream political culture., When the Supreme Court opened the door to legally assisted death last week, I imagined I could hear my mom applauding. She did not believe in unnecessary suffering. She did not have a good death. The terrible pain she experienced made her last weeks on Earth a living hell.But the option of assisted death will do very little to address the bigger problem we face. Without broad changes in medical and social practices, a 'good death' will probably continue to elude most of us. Ideally, we'd all live in robust health till age 95, then die quietly in our sleep. In the real world, few of us will be so lucky. For most, the slow march toward the end will be marked by a lurching slide into increasing debility, punctuated by repeated hospitalization and painful, often futile treatments. Too many of us will die in institutions, hooked up to machines, with chemo in our blood - victims of all the best modern medicine has to offer.What really matters in the end? This is the question American surgeon Atul Gawande tackles in his book Being Mortal - an utterly unflinching yet compassionate account of old age and end-of-life issues. If you have any older people in your life, or plan to be one yourself some day, you need to read it.Dr. Gawande points out that most physicians are miserable at talking to their patients about death. One study found that two-thirds of terminal cancer patients reported having had no discussion with their doctors about goals for end-of-life care - even though they were on average just four months from death. A recent Canadian study found that nearly half of all cancer patients still die in a hospital, rather than in a hospice or at home.For doctors, death is a defeat. Their every impulse is to treat, even when treatment probably won't prolong life and may well inflict more suffering. 'We imagine that we can wait until the doctors tell us that there is nothing more they can do,' Dr. Gawande says. 'But rarely is there nothing more that doctors can do ... We fall back on the default, and the default is: Do Something. Fix Something.'Brian Goldman, a Canadian emergency-room doctor, couldn't agree more. 'It's the rare physician who prepares patients to die well, or who will even acknowledge that death is possible, much less imminent,' he wrote last month in Chatelaine.There's another problem. Institutional indifference, callousness and failure can (and often does) defeat our good intentions. That's what happened to my mom.During her last year of life, it was increasingly obvious that she was sick. She lost a lot of weight and complained that she was in pain. But, probably because she knew the truth, she refused to see a doctor about it. Finally, when the pain became unbearable, she agreed to go. He sent her for a test, which showed a 'mass' in her abdomen. He wouldn't tell us what that meant, but he didn't sound optimistic. It turned out to be advanced pancreatic cancer.Mom wound up in one of the best hospitals in Canada. 'All I want is something for the pain,' she begged as we waited for her to be admitted. I promised she would get it. The doctors and nurses told us not to worry - they would control the pain. But they didn't. For some inexplicable reason, the pain medication was severely rationed, and she was suffering epic waves of pain. We complained to everyone in sight, but it did no good. I would sit with her and beg her to hang in there until the scheduled time came for her next dose. One night, when it failed to arrive, I frantically hunted down the nurse, who told me snippily that he didn't have time to attend to Mom because he had paperwork to do.This kind of institutional malpractice, I've learned, is not terribly unusual. Doctors have told me it happens all the time. Still, I feel that I profoundly failed my mom. She asked me for just one thing, and she didn't get it.My point is that the vast majority of the frail, the elderly and dying - people like my mother - don't need assisted death to ease their passing. What they really need is a vast culture change in the way we care for them. What they and their families need is the assurance that simple compassion and humanity will not be smothered by complex systems and bureaucracy. Unfortunately, no law can guarantee that., Forces are lining up against the bid by Porter Airlines to get permission to fly jets out of the Toronto island airport. That is a shame, because many of the objections to allowing jets are weak or capable of being resolved with a little effort.When Porter first made its proposal, the biggest concerns were about noise from the jets and how a lengthened runway would encroach on the harbour and the lake. Those concerns have since faded.A report from City of Toronto staff concedes that the Bombardier CS100 jets that Porter wants to fly would 'likely' meet existing noise limits, even if we won't know for sure till the plane is certified by next May. An attached consultants report says the plane is 'expected to be certified with noise levels similar' to the turboprops Porter flies at present and that the new planes should 'operate at or below' current noise limits.In any case, Bombardier has guaranteed Porter that the plane will meet the limits. Consultants also conclude that the new jets - part of a quieter, cleaner new generation of aviation technology - will meet air-pollution standards.As for the runway, Porter wants to lengthen it by up to 200 metres on each end to let the jets land and take off. Opponents say this would mean 'paving the lake,' as Adam Vaughan, Porter's fiercest city-council critic, once put it. But the consultants who reported on the issue found that the longer runway would 'maintain the existing depth' of the current Marine Exclusion Zone, a buoyed-off area to keep boats away from planes. In other words, boats would still have just as much room in the harbour, though the buoyed zone might have to be widened slightly for the rebuilt runway.With the greater noise and lake-paving arguments debunked, opponents have been shifting their line of attack. They now say it is not so much what would happen to noise levels or the lake waters that is the issue. It is what would happen on the ground. Mr. Vaughan argues that it would cost as much as half a billion dollars to build better infrastructure to deal with the increased traffic that jets would bring to the airport.Spending that much would be extravagant and, fortunately, it should not be necessary. The number of flights that can travel in and out of the island is limited by the fact that it has only one runway. The number of slots for arriving and departing planes is expected to remain the same.The number of passengers could go up regardless because the jets are bigger and carry more passengers than the turboprops. Consultants estimate it could lead to an 'incremental increase' in the airport's capacity, to 4.3 million passengers a year from 3.8 million at present. In a high-growth scenario, that could grow to 4.8 million. But if the worry is that the airport will just keep growing and growing with no end in sight, why not negotiate with Porter to put a cap on the number of annual passengers?The passenger tunnel currently being built under the Western Gap should ease the flow of the increased traffic. More work will be needed to make sure that vehicular and other travel to the airport from the city side does not grow tangled, as it can do even now.This is the most legitimate of the concerns about the jets proposal, but it is far from insuperable. The city staff report's estimate of $180-million to $300-million for ground-side infrastructure includes expensive projects like tunnels, bridges and streetcar lines that may not be necessary. Better airport shuttle service and a few road improvements could make a big difference. Consultants put the cost of one round of road upgrades at just $2-million to $3-million.The airport is a valuable asset for Toronto. An ambitious city would try to overcome the concerns over introducing jets, not allow itself to be paralyzed by them., Everyone loves firefighters. They save lives. They are strong and competent. They look good on calendars. People are always happy when they show up.But municipalities do not love firefighters. Across Canada, towns and cities are getting hosed by the skyrocketing costs of their fire departments. Thanks to arbitration settlements, your firefighters are the best paid (and possibly the most underworked) guys in town. Firefighters have been getting raises that are twice as high what other public sector workers have been getting, at a time when municipalities are strapped for funds and raises are just a memory for most of us.Here in Toronto, firefighters recently won a 14-per-cent wage increase over five years, which means that by next year, a first-class firefighter will be making $90,000. But it's the small towns that are hit worst. Tiny Owen Sound, Ont. (population 32,092), has 29 full-time fire professionals. Last year, 25 of them made more than $100,000. The median full-time income of people who live in Owen Sound is less than half that.For smaller cities, the fire department is typically the largest item in the budget. It accounts for upward of a quarter of their costs. But municipalities are powerless to control firefighters' salaries, because negotiations with the union almost always wind up in arbitration. And arbitrators aren't obliged to give much weight to a town's ability to pay. Instead, they simply match the settlements that everybody else got, including police. So the costs spiral ever upward, and towns are forced to cut back on libraries and roads. As Toronto city manager Joe Pennachetti told the Toronto Sun: 'We feel like we're banging our heads against the wall.'There's no good reason for salaries to go up so much, argues John Saunders, a consultant with Hicks Morley who advises dozens of municipalities. Firefighting is an extremely desirable job, and vacancies are scarce because people rarely quit. Last year, for example, there were more than 500 applicants for 20 firefighting jobs in the Ontario communities of Cambridge, Kitchener and Waterloo. In Cambridge, a first-class firefighter earns up to $99,397 a year, plus benefits and overtime. Yet despite the high demand for their jobs, firefighters get 'retention' payments for not quitting.Working conditions are pretty sweet too. Thanks to modern safety standards, there are very few fires left to fight. These days, most fire department calls are medical. To prove that they're still needed, fire departments have been adding defibrillators and Jaws of Life, and frantically expanding their repertoires to respond to even minor non-fire emergencies. Still, there's an awful lot of what we shall euphemistically call 'down time,' which firemen fill by preparing meals, sleeping, watching television, polishing the trucks and rewinding the hoses.It's long past time to roll back firefighting costs, as cities across the United States have been forced to do. But in Canada, costs continue to escalate as unions demand even better benefits, shorter work weeks and highly desirable 24-hour shifts. Firefighters love 24-hour shifts because it gives them plenty of time off for their other jobs. Theoretically, they're required to work seven or eight of these shifts in a 28-day period, but workers with plenty of seniority can wind up working just five or six shifts, according to Mr. Saunders. Some critics refer to the 24-hour arrangement as 'a well-paid part-time job.' (As for how it's possible to work 24 hours in a row, the answer is 'down time.')Not even the smallest effort to control costs goes unchallenged. In Windsor, the union grieved a decision to pull a fire truck out of service in 2008, saying that the administration had promised to leave it in service until the new contract was settled, which still hasn't happened. The arbitrator sided with the union and told the city to cough up $381,000 in theoretically lost overtime - $1,328 for each member of the fire department. Meanwhile, in Toronto, the firefighters' union continues its endless war against Emergency Medical Services, claiming that a decision to stop dispatching million-dollar pumpers to lower-level 911 calls puts lives at risk. A consultants' report said that a merger of fire and EMS could save the city significant money - but the tribal warfare is so bitter that it will never happen.I have nothing against firefighters, personally. But times have changed. We can't go on like this. I could write the same column about the police. You guys are supposed to protect us. But we can't afford you any more., Ted Menzies is one of nature's gentlemen. He just might be the most popular member of Parliament among his peers. He's the Minister of State for Finance, a junior cabinet post, and he would likely have been promoted in the forthcoming cabinet shuffle.Instead, Mr. Menzies is leaving politics. He's told Prime Minister Stephen Harper that he won't be running again. Was he afraid of losing? Are you kidding? He owns the southern Alberta riding of Macleod. He's a member of the Conservatives' '70 per cent club' - Alberta MPs who win more than 70 per cent of a riding's votes. He could have continued his political career as long as he desired. Instead, he'll be doing something else after the next election.Mr. Menzies was the last former Alberta Progressive Conservative left in the new Conservative Party created by Stephen Harper. When Mr. Menzies sought the nomination, he ran against a clutch of Reform Party types who cancelled each other out and allowed him to slide to victory. Once nominated, the election was a formality.All the other Alberta Conservative MPs are either from the old Reform Party or weren't involved in electoral politics before running for office. With his departure, the Alberta caucus will shift just a bit further to the right.Mr. Menzies's moderate breed is rare in Alberta Conservative circles, where most MPs are open or closet supporters of the provincial Wildrose Party. Of course, Mr. Menzies followed his party's script as a cabinet minister, but he was almost anti-partisan, or at least seemed to be, in a party where hyper-partisanship and all-pervasive combat set the tone.As the summer cabinet shuffle nears, much breath is being wasted on whether ministerial changes will make much of a difference for a government slumping so badly in the polls. Two years ago, the Conservatives enjoyed twice the support of the Liberals; today, they trail the Liberals by many points. In many polls, the Conservatives have dropped below 30-per-cent support for the first time since they were first elected seven years ago.Cabinet shuffles themselves don't change political fortunes. Most voters can't name more than two or three of them. They do know prime ministers, and vote more than anything else on what they think of them. And like other prime ministers, Mr. Harper isn't about to change his demeanour or style after all these years. The Conservatives will win or lose with him, not a new cabinet.One wonders, as Mr. Menzies departs, what the government would have been like had his gentlemanly attitude been more on display from this government. A government's tone and style gradually shape an electorate's view. Do people feel comfortable with the men and women running the show? That's usually a more pertinent question than whether this or that policy change is understood, accepted or rejected.And this government's tone and style are beginning to wear on more and more Canadians. The ferocious partisanship, the excessive secrecy, the negative television ads, the mendacity directed at opponents, the overwhelming sense that enemies (including most of the media, of course) abound, the almost manic preoccupation with spin and image and now the little scandals from the Senate have created the impression, outside the Conservative core, of a government that has ideology and agenda but not much heart, empathy, feeling or understanding for anyone who doesn't share that ideology and agenda.Mr. Menzies smiles a lot, not for effect but because that's the way he is. As such, he stood out in a cabinet full of scowlers. Ask yourself: How many senior Conservatives smile? Most are so scripted by the Prime Minister's Office that they dare not show whatever humour they possess, or they turn it into sarcastic blasts at the opposition.There will be a cabinet shuffle soon, and some new faces will appear. They will adapt to the government's tone and style, which are set at the top., In December, The Program for International Students Assessment (PISA) released the latest international student test results. Unfortunately, the good standing of Canadian education (fourth in reading and top ten in math and science out of 70 countries) was buried by the news that Canadian students' ability in math is on the decline. This 2 per cent decrease in PISA scores, from 527 to 518, sent pundits, parents and politicians into a frenzy.After more than a month of popular debate and discussion - and with a potential provincial election looming - Ontario Education Minister Liz Sandals unveiled a math plan to '...battle the province's poor test scores...'. The $4-million initiative placed the responsibility for addressing Ontario students' declining math scores on teachers and parents. Meanwhile, the minister defended the math curriculum and refused to consider a 'shake up' of teaching methods.Most of the recent discussion on how we're teaching math in Canadian schools has focussed on who is to blame for the problem and how best to fix it. Almost no one has contemplated whether using international test scores as the basis for education policy decisions is a sound strategy. Canadians have taken PISA's scores and rankings at face value without ever considering if they're correct.The 2011 Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) indicated that, contrary to the 2012 PISA results, 'Ontario students have shown significant improvement' in math and more than 70 per cent of Ontario students tested at or above the benchmark. Why are these findings at odds with the PISA findings only a year later?There is a growing body of academic evidence that PISA test scores aren't accurate reflections of student learning. Cambridge statistician David Spiegelhalter expressed '...fairly serious concerns...' about PISA's 2012 testing methods and data analysis, while University of Copenhagen's Svend Kreiner calls PISA results 'useless'. Prof. Kreiner also demonstrated that in PISA's 2006 test, Canada could have placed 'anywhere from second place to 25th' using PISA's methodology. Other prominent academic statisticians call PISA results and methods 'utterly wrong' and 'problematic'.In response PISA admits that a 'large variation in single ranking positions is likely' owing to 'the uncertainty that results from sample data'. Prof. Spiegelhalter goes further, stating 'It's unwise for countries to base education policy on their Pisa results'. To do so is 'to underestimate the random error associated with the Pisa results', he says.In any case, high international test scores may be meaningless. Keith Baker, a U.S. Department of Education researcher, found no correlation between international test scores and prosperity. Education levels help fuel growth up to point, but once a country achieves an optimal level of education, traits like creativity, perseverance and ambition become more important. Mr. Baker believes that constantly pursuing higher test scores is bad education policy, as it reduces the focus in schools on developing those other important traits.While it's questionable whether we have a 'crisis' in Canadian math education the discussion and debate around learning math is paving the way forward. In the late 1980's and early 1990's educators and parents heatedly discussed the merits of whole language and phonics approaches in teaching reading. Out of those discussions came balanced literacy programs which use the best of both approaches and have led to our current strength in teaching reading.The opposite poles of 'discovery math' and 'back to basics' are theoretical rather than practical. I don't use one method exclusively in my grade 5 classroom, nor do I know any teacher that does. We're using inquiry methods more, but we also use more traditional methods when they're effective.The curriculum requires my students to mentally add, subtract, multiply and divide and it's a skill we develop daily. Students also work on open-ended problems and, in doing so, foster higher-order thinking skills. These two approaches aren't an 'either/or', but rather an opportunity to add new strategies to what we know already works.The drawback of deciding education policy through public debate is that positions become polarized and the nuance of understanding required to enhance student learning in the classroom is lost. Every student is unique and no single approach will be effective for every student. Similarly, student learning can't be effectively distilled down and represented by a test score.International tests, such as PISA provide impartial feedback that encourages us to reflect and consider ways to improve our education system. They are not, however, the definitive word, and should not be used as the basis for policy decisions. The collective future of our students is much too important for that.Andrew Campbell is a teacher at Major Ballachey Public School in Brantford, Ont., an educator for over 20 years and the father of three sons., Changes in Canadian public policy tend to be incremental, but a groundswell seems to be building for a plan that could radically remake our social benefits structure.The idea - guaranteed annual income - is not new; it's been argued over by academics since at least the 1940s, and a version was tested in Manitoba in the 1970s. What's different this time is proponents now find themselves in positions of power in municipal governments, provincial legislatures and on Parliament Hill.Quebec Premier Philippe Couillard says he's 'dead serious' about trying it, and last month appointed a cabinet committee to that end. It is presided by Labour Minister Francois Blais, a former Laval University political science professor who just happens to have written a book on minimum income programs.Last week, another Laval academic - Jean-Yves Duclos, a former economics professor who after his election last year became the federal Families, Children and Social Development Minister - says he too is willing to look at implementing it.The concept is simple. Replace the raft of income-support provisions currently administered, means-tested, audited and doled out by various levels of government - welfare, community housing allowances, employment insurance - with a single benefit. It could be run through the tax system. If your income is below a certain level, you get a cheque.Many conservatives have long liked the idea, which triggers the same intellectual-pleasure regions as a flat tax and could make government small and more efficient. The suggestion in Quebec is the province could shutter at least one department entirely. That appeals to the austerity-minded wing of Mr. Couillard's cabinet.Fans on the left - see Alberta's NDP Finance Minister Joe Ceci, who before politics was an anti-poverty advocate - like the universality and the idea it could reduce income and social inequality.The arguments against guaranteed income are also well-established, the main one being that it could act as a disincentive to work. Another is that governments can safely be relied upon to screw things up, as they arguably did in Dauphin, Man.It's time to test the assumptions in the real world. Launch some guaranteed annual income pilot programs. Let's see how theory translates into practice in Canada., Paul Heinbecker, a former ambassador to the UN, is with the Centre for International Governance Innovation, the Balsillie School and Laurier University in WaterlooSince just before Christmas, when the United Nations Security Council adopted Resolution 2334 on Israeli settlements, the drama of the fractious personal relationships of Benjamin Netanyahu, Donald Trump and Barack Obama has dominated media coverage. A lot of this commentary is missing the point: The resolution, which passed 14-0-1 (the United States abstained), and its strong objections to Israeli settlement building are more portentous than the transitory political theatre surrounding it.Resolution 2334 is important because it joins other milestone UN resolutions, including General Assembly resolution 181 that partitioned Palestine and led to the proclamation of Israel; resolution 194 which resolved that peace-minded refugees of the 1948 war should be permitted to return to their homes; and Security Council resolutions 242 and 338 that emphasized the 'inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by war.' Together these and a small handful of other resolutions guide the judgments of the vast majority of UN member-state governments on Israeli-Palestinian issues.Resolution 2334 was passed under Chapter VI of the UN Charter on the peaceful settlement of disputes and thus does not entail enforcement options. The language of resolution 2334 is nonetheless unequivocal that Israel's settlements in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, have 'no legal validity,' that they constitute 'a flagrant violation of international law,' and that they are 'a major obstacle to the achievement of the two-state solution and a just, lasting and comprehensive peace.'Israeli and Palestinian narratives notwithstanding, resolution 2334 reflects what the world thinks. It does not constitute a minority view or even a very divided view. If this resolution of the 15-member UN Security Council were put to a vote in the 193-member General Assembly, the outcome would scarcely be different.The resolution does not question Israel's right to exist; in fact, if anything it reinforces that right. The resolution invites UN member states to distinguish 'in their relevant dealings between the territory of the state of Israel and the territories occupied since 1967.' At the same time, these distinctions could encourage less positive consequences for Israel. For example, importing states could demand certificates of origin for goods produced by Israeli firms in the occupied territories.U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry's follow-up valedictory speech this week endorsed the resolution and detailed the Obama administration's frustration in managing relations with Jerusalem, and in its vain efforts to negotiate peace based on a two-state solution. Mr. Kerry's speech - some called it a eulogy for a Palestinian state - was directed variously at Americans, Israelis and the international community and echoed many of the themes of the resolution. Mr. Kerry uncharacteristically directly criticized the Israeli government for being, in Mr. Netanyahu's own words, 'more committed to settlements than any in Israel's history' and expressed particular frustration that the settler agenda, which opposes a Palestinian state, was defining Israel's future. 'If the choice is one state, Israel can either be Jewish or democratic; it cannot be both and it will not ever really be at peace,' Mr. Kerry said.Mr. Kerry was mindful that influential voices in Mr. Trump's transition team and in the Israeli cabinet, including ministers Naftali Bennett and Ayelet Shaked, have spoken favourably of Israel's annexing the West Bank altogether. Meanwhile, a Pew poll earlier this year found that nearly half of Israeli Jews said Arabs should be expelled or transferred from Israel and that 79 per cent of Israeli Jews agreed that Israel should give preferential treatment to Jews.Mr. Kerry used his speech to suggest six goals to guide future peace negotiations: secure and recognized international borders based on the 1967 lines with mutually agreed land swaps; two states for two peoples with mutual recognition and full equal rights for their minority citizens; a just, agreed, fair and realistic solution to the Palestinian refugee issue; Jerusalem as the capital of both states; an end to the occupation; and renunciation of all claims by both sides. But Mr. Kerry appeared to scotch the rumour that the Security Council would endorse these principles before Mr. Obama leaves office.Mr. Netanyahu is apparently counting on his ability to persuade president-elect Trump and the U.S. Congress to back his policies. But even if they do, neither will be able to erase resolution 2334. The great majority of UN member governments, including powerful ones like Russia and China, still want to see a two-state solution, and U.S. veto power is unavailing in these circumstances. Nor would U.S. defunding of the UN reverse this resolution; the U.S. has defaulted on its contributions before and the UN has survived. And, if the U.S. were to walk away from the UN, as some suggest, who would shield Israel then? Perhaps as a precaution, nevertheless, we should dust off plans for the UN to move to Canada., Prime Minister Stephen Harper should clarify whether he thinks the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court acted inappropriately, as he appears to have alleged. We say 'appears' because Mr. Harper is being passive-aggressive with regard to this matter, tossing out an accusation that doesn't seem to have any basis in law or fact, and then refusing to comment.Mr. Harper issued a statement last week saying Chief Justice Beverley McLachlin tried to contact him last year, when rumours were circulating in legal circles that he was preparing to name a Federal Court judge to one of the three high court spots reserved for Quebeckers. The potential appointment of Marc Nadon was contentious, since Mr. Nadon was not a member of the Quebec bar, and that appeared to disqualify him under the terms of the Supreme Court Act. Mr. Harper went ahead regardless, the appointment was immediately challenged, and the government referred the issue to the Supreme Court itself. The justices ruled 6-1 that the appointment didn't meet the requirements of the law; Chief Justice McLachlin was one of the six in the majority.Chief Justice McLachlin has not hidden the fact she attempted to contact the Prime Minister, nor should she. As Chief Justice, she is expected to consult with the government about the needs of the court. It is fair to say that she wanted to signal an issue that might delay the arrival of a new justice and leave her short a body for an extended period - which, of course, is exactly what has happened.Since her communication with the PMO occurred before Mr. Nadon's appointment, it is hard to see how Chief Justice McLachlin was interfering with an active case, since there was no case until several months later. Still, if the government was truly concerned about her neutrality, its lawyers could have asked her to recuse herself from the reference case. They did not.Ten months later, Mr. Harper is suddenly calling into question the appropriateness of the Chief Justice's actions, after the court has ruled against his government. It is entirely appropriate for the PM to criticize a court decision, and criticize this decision he has. Fair enough. But taking petty potshots at the Chief Justice's professionalism? It undermines confidence in one of our most vital institutions. It also undermines confidence in Mr. Harper., It's worth watching the documentary Flora: Scenes from a Leadership Convention to see how much has changed in 40 years (goodbye, plaid pantsuits and comb-overs!) and how much has not (Hello, female political leaders! Hello? Hello?).In 1976, Flora MacDonald ran for the leadership of the Progressive Conservatives, one of the first women to vie for top spot of a major Canadian political party. She lost, you may recall, to Joe Clark. The documentary by Peter Raymont shows her as the remarkable, dignified and groundbreaking politician we knew her to be. (Ms. MacDonald died last month at the age of 89; the Prime Minister did not attend her funeral.)'Because women do not perceive of themselves in the role of a leader,' she said during her campaign, 'it is difficult for them to perceive of another woman in the role of a leader. The more that position is tried for by women, the more it explodes that myth.'Her adviser, savvy Eddie Goodman, was more pithy: 'The country was ready for a woman leader. The party was not.'Was Canada ready for a female leader? Is it now? The evidence would suggest not. We had one, once, for several months 22 years ago, but Kim Campbell did not win an election to become prime minister. The days of the NDP's Audrey McLaughlin and Alexa McDonough are fading fast in the rear-view mirror.How about this election? There's a lot of testosterone up there on those debate stages. At least the Green Party's Elizabeth May will be around for some of the debates (although not the one hosted by this newspaper).The last federal election in 2011 was seen as a breakthrough because 25 per cent of MPs were women. I'd call it a breakthrough if it were 75 per cent; I'd settle for parity. Although the nominations for this election haven't closed yet, of the candidates that have been named for ridings, only 30 per cent are women, according to the advocacy group Equal Voice. In 55 ridings, there are no female candidates.There is 'still a lot of work to be done,' Equal Voice's Nancy Peckford says on the phone from Ottawa. She talks about the 'incumbency advantage' that accrues to electoral veterans. 'Once we've achieved those breakthroughs, we are generally able to hold on to them. But it is infusing new women in the system that is the challenge.'The barriers to women's political participation are well studied. Some are internal, it can't be denied: Women are generally more anxious than male candidates about how they will be perceived on the campaign trail, and are perhaps put off by the belligerent dysfunctionality of the system.But more important are the external factors: the exclusionary riding associations, the denial of long-standing support systems and financial backing.As a report this year from the World Bank's Women in Parliaments project put it, 'While both men and women express concern about the many pitfalls of political campaigning, females are more worried over all, particularly about gender discrimination, the difficulty of fundraising, negative advertising, the loss of privacy, and not being taken seriously.'Female candidates receive fewer private donations, the report found, and women by a wide margin are underrepresented at the ministerial levels.Recently, Ms. Campbell talked about a gender-quota system to ensure fairness in federal elections. This was met by predictable shrieks of outrage by people who think historically biased systems of governance will magically sort themselves out with the wave of some fairy godmother's wand. Make that fairy godfather.While I don't agree with the former prime minister on the specifics of her suggestion (two candidates elected per riding, one male and one female), I think she is right about quotas. Quotas are not an anomaly; they are the norm in many parts of the world. In terms of women represented in political office, Canada ranks 46th out of 140 countries, according to the Inter-Parliamentary Union.Many of the countries that do better than us have some formal system of promoting women into office, through reserved seats or candidates' lists or mentorship programs. Many of those countries use a proportional representation system, it's true, but there's not much we can do about that.Almost 100 countries have some form of gender quotas in politics, whether legislated or voluntary, at the level of parliaments or at the level of party recruitment. Germany is one of them: It hasn't worked so badly there, has it?, The U.S. presidential election, starring Donald Trump and a growing cast of antagonists, is now officially stranger than fiction, and more estranged from reality than the most implausible reality TV plot. Mr. Trump, who has spent the past week expanding and deepening his enemies' list, may now be in the process of losing the election. He is definitely in the advanced stages of losing the Republican Party, or at least its traditional establishment.Is Mr. Trump self-destructing, and melting down in a sea of his own indiscipline, narcissism and stubborn unwillingness to moderate his message or his behaviour? Maybe. But voting day isn't until November, and three months is a heck of a long time in politics.And until last week, almost everything had been going The Donald's way. Despite changing nothing after the end of the primaries, and continuing a campaign whose style is off-the-cuff chaos and whose message is fear, his polls numbers climbed through the early summer. He came out of the Republican National Convention in a dead heat with Hillary Clinton. Considering that mainstream Republican politicians had been saying since last year that Mr. Trump could never be nominated, and if nominated would lose the general election in a landslide, Mr. Trump's rising prospects were an accomplishment and a surprise.But this may be the week where Trump being Trump finally started to undo him. Until now, the more he disrespected rivals, tagging them with elementary schoolyard taunts - Little Marco Rubio, Lyin' Ted Cruz, #CrookedHillary - the more at least some voters warmed to what they took to be his unscripted, politically incorrect honesty. His daily emission of odd and crazy pronouncements, which would have been fatal gaffes for any other candidate; his inability to feel shame or embarrassment or remorse; even his repeated self-contradictions on virtually every policy save for the desire to build The Great Anti-Mexican Wall, all were somehow translating into greater popularity.This week, however, Mr. Trump went after Khizr Khan, the father of a Muslim-American soldier killed fighting in Iraq. Mr. Khan had taken the stage at the Democratic National Convention to attack Mr. Trump, and Mr. Trump spent the next few days pushing back rather than moving on. Many Republicans immediately distanced themselves from the candidate. Even his vice-presidential running mate, Mike Pence described Mr. Khan's son as 'an American hero,' whose family 'should be cherished by every American.'Then Mr. Trump refused to endorse the candidacies of several senior Republican senators who are up for re-election. Mr. Trump's fights with other Republicans were understandable when he was running to take over the party and wrest it from a hostile establishment. But now that he's the name at the top of the ticket, why try to publicly undermine Senators Paul Ryan, John McCain and Kelly Ayotte? Good question. Because after Mr. Trump refused to endorse them, his running mate Mr. Pence did the exact opposite.While all of that was happening, the list of prominent Republicans denouncing Mr. Trump was growing. It includes at least one GOP congressman who is urging his constituents to vote for Ms. Clinton, and Hewlett Packard Enterprise CEO and former California gubernatorial candidate Meg Whitman, who is fundraising for her.Analysis: Why the world wants Clinton to winAnd the crazy thing is, there may be method, and even a certain genius, in what otherwise looks like Mr. Trump's self-immolating madness.His constant battles within the GOP are part of his popularity - at least for many conservative voters. He has to know that winning the election is going to be a stretch - but if he plays his cards right, he and his movement/cult of personality can cement their control of the party. That's because, as the size and passion of his rallies demonstrate, Mr. Trump is more popular with Republican voters than any other Republican. And in politics, popularity is the coin of the realm. He may not have the Republican establishment on his side, but he apparently has a lot of their voters. That may be because a lot of long-time Republican voters, possibly even the majority, don't like the current Republican Party.On Wednesday, Fox News host Sean Hannity was channelling those people when he laid Mr. Trump's calamitous week not at the feet of its author, Mr. Trump, but instead blamed the Republican establishment.'If in 96 days Trump loses this election,' he told listeners of his radio show, 'I am pointing the finger directly at people like Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell and Lindsey Graham and John McCain.'He described the GOP as having been 'more harsh toward Donald Trump than they've ever been in standing up to Barack Obama and his radical agenda,' and said that Mr. Trump's candidacy was necessary 'because of your ineffectiveness, because of your weakness, your spinelessness, your lack of vision, your inability to fight Obama .... I'm getting a little sick and tired of all of you. I am, honestly, I am tempted to just say, I don't support any of you people, ever.'To readers not resident within the Trumpian headspace or the Tea Party universe, it sounds certifiably nuts. Yet Mr. Hannity's words reflect the views of many of his viewers and listeners. As far as they're concerned, when the Messiah finally showed up, instead of welcoming him, the Republican establishment betrayed him. If Mr. Trump loses the election, he and his supporters will peddle a stab-in-the-back myth. They'll say the GOP went full Judas on their boy.Donald Trump may be leading the GOP into its worst defeat in since Barry Goldwater in 1964. He may cost it control of the Senate and the House, handing all three branches of government to the Democrats. Then again, win or lose, he and his followers have one eye on the job of purging the GOP of moderates, intellectuals and the old guard, thereby remaking the party in his image: meaner, cruder, angrier - and dangerously unstable., In early April it appeared the Canadian government might be able to pull off a dual Middle East strategy, combining co-operation with the conservative Gulf Arab states on security matters and sweeping support for current Israeli policies. John Baird, the foreign minister, had reason to be confident during the initial segments of his Middle East trek that month. There is no reason to doubt his assertion that Israeli policy was never raised with him in the Arab countries he visited, such is the Gulf leaders' overwhelming preoccupation with their own security. Nor would it have had a major role in discussions in Jordan, given King Abdullah's preoccupation with the challenge posed by the Muslim Brotherhood, the burden of Syrian refugees and the Kingdom's economic situation.As Mr. Baird entered Israel, the score seemed 10 for the government, nil for the skeptics. To maintain that score, the minister would have been best to limit himself to established rhetoric and practice. The Arabs might have swallowed hard but they had seemingly learned to live with such policies. Had Mr. Baird chosen to go even further with a phrase or two cautioning Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu with respect to settlements in the West Bank, as did President Barack Obama during his May visit to Israel, he could have emerged from the region well satisfied.At some point, however, the minister decided to strike out beyond the anticipated. He met the Israeli cabinet minister Tzipi Livni in Arab East Jerusalem, which is in Palestinian eyes the capital of their future state. Such a simple meeting may on the surface have appeared innocent, although there seem to have been outside players who tried to warn the minister off. But such an encounter crossed a critical red line in the competing narratives of Arabs and Israelis.While Qatar and others were prepared to overlook their concerns about Canada more generally, Mr. Baird's Jerusalem gesture went too far. It challenged a well-established status quo, whereby foreign dignitaries do not visit the Arab part of the city to conduct business with Israelis.As the location of the third holiest site in Islam, under Muslim rule for longer than Anglo-Saxons have been in Britain and the place from which Mohammed by tradition ascended into heaven, East Jerusalem goes to the core of the Arab cultural and religious narrative regardless of sect. There is a widespread fear that symbolic moves, seemingly innocent in themselves, will gradually facilitate Israel's absorption of this sacred space, divesting Arab Muslims of respect and dignity. They see such seemingly innocuous steps as part and parcel of a broader policy involving discriminatory zoning and planning, demolitions, evictions and archeological excavations.Such accusations may or may not unfairly pillory Israelis, but what matters here is that they reflect deeply held beliefs. That is why Canadian governments have traditionally taken what has been called a 'fair-minded' approach to such matters: concern, a willingness to use our good offices and sensitivity to the claims and needs of both sides. Historically when we have departed from such a path, there have been repercussions: in 1979 when Joe Clark, as leader of the opposition and then as Prime Minister, promised to move the Canadian Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to (albeit Jewish West) Jerusalem, Arab reaction was swift and negative. In their minds the move was aimed at legitimizing Israel's claim to the city in its entirety. Mr. Clark appointed his much-respected predecessor as leader of the Conservative party, Robert Stanfield, to rethink the matter. Former prime minister Brian Mulroney, an admiring friend of Israel, watched language and gestures carefully, with Mr. Clark's miscalculation much in mind.The current government has proven itself to be a much more assertive advocate of Israeli policies and practices. The Arabs have disliked Canada for it. They had generally held their fire, the not unimportant exception being their part in derailing our bid for a seat on the United Nations Security Council. That done, and in the process of establishing new Arab relationships, Canada, intentionally or not, has set off the tripwire once again, undervaluing narrative and emotion and the inferred insult such a step suggests when Arab honour is at stake.The Qataris, after consultations with and the concurrence of other Arab governments, decided to undercut us again through their bid to see the International Civil Aviation Organization moved from Montreal to Doha. That the Qatari decision seemed sudden should not delude us that it is not serious. There will now be a struggle for votes with money on their side and organizational and operational logic on ours.Reasoned judgment respecting the operation and integrity of UN-based institutions will probably prevail, but in this world of power and politics nothing is certain.Michael Bell is a former Ambassador of Canada to Israel, Egypt, Jordan and the Palestinian territories. He was executive assistant to Robert Stanfield during the Jerusalem Embassy affair of 1979-80., Michael Bell is an adjunct professor of political science at the University of Windsor, and also teaches at Carleton University. He served as Canada's ambassador to Jordan, Egypt and Israel.Crude violence has become Jerusalem's leitmotif within the space of days: Palestinian terrorists running down Israelis in the streets, a bus driver's possible lynching and, most shockingly, Tuesday's slaughter at the Kehilot Bnei Torah synagogue. These atrocities reflect an explosive, chaotic situation in this sacred city, where there seems to be no solution, barring a far-reaching but seemingly impossible peace agreement.As it stands, accusations and counteraccusations run unchecked. Naftali Bennett, head of the ultranationalist Jewish Home party, accused Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas of complicity, if not active participation, in the violence. (The president added fuel to the fire by sending a message of sympathy to the family of one Palestinian perpetrator who died in a shootout.) But while Mr. Abbas may be ineffective, the depth of the Palestinian Authority's anti-terrorist co-operation with Israel puts the lie to the notion of his complicity - this is emotional and overheated rhetoric, a trait political leaders of all stripes seem almost inevitably drawn to.There is no doubt that Israeli security authorities will clamp down further on Palestinians' freedoms, especially those of Israeli Arabs, because they can move and organize to disrupt Israeli life more easily than those in the West Bank and Gaza. The degree of this clampdown - and how successful it will be - remains to be determined. Yoram Cohen, director of Israel's Shin Bet security agency, testified before the Knesset, in seeming contradiction to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, that the perpetrators of the synagogue massacre had never been judged security risks and were not connected to any political organization. The West Bank, Jerusalem and Israeli Arab society are nevertheless penetrated by Hamas, the militant group whose frustrations, language and actions have helped create this volcanic environment.Whatever the case, what choice do the Israelis have but to clamp down? No government can accept that its citizens be massacred. The Israeli challenge is to permanently control a situation where Palestinians feel, rightly or wrongly, that they are increasingly deprived of basic human rights in what seems like a one-state solution, a greater Israel, that excludes them from any pretense of participation.Having lived in Israel for nine years on three separate occasions between 1975 and 2003, and having visited many times since, I must confess that I don't know the answer. If there is one, it consists of two viable states, Israel and Palestine, along the lines of the recently abandoned John Kerry initiative, the exact contents of which the U.S. administration will not discuss publicly. Neither side will settle for less than what they see as their dignity.Differing cultures, identities, ideologies, customs, images and ethnicities seem bred in the bone here, propagating exclusivity coupled with a consequent and enduring distrust of the other. The synagogue massacre is only the most recent manifestation of the evil effects of such mindsets, demonstrating yet more clearly that the two sides cannot live together with any semblance of normalcy. Israeli practices cannot be exempted from this conundrum, nor can be the decades-long refusal of many Palestinians to accept the legitimacy of the Jewish state, whatever its boundaries. But greater Israel is a breeding ground for terror.Nothing is more sensitive than the holy sites of Jerusalem, to which both sides attach their very being. Exclusive control of the Old City by one or the other is anathema to the other. It would violate what each sees as its sacred trust.Rightly or wrongly, the Palestinians live in fear that Israeli ultranationalists will erode the longstanding modus vivendi of Muslim control over prayer on the Haram al-Sharif, known to Israelis as the Temple Mount. Having seen what they view as their homeland, including East Jerusalem, increasingly subject to land confiscation, housing demolition and Israeli settlement growth, Palestinians now live in an atmosphere of fear and distrust respecting the holy sites.With the growth of the religious right in Israel, tensions are high and sensitivities extreme. Ultrareligious Jews are seen as eroding the sanctity of the control Muslims now have. Messianic militants, led by Yehuda Glick, demand that both Jews and Muslims have equal prayer rights, which would effectively end the status quo established in 1967 - a development Muslims would view, rightly or wrongly, as their final humiliation. Despite his own accusations about Palestinian culpability in the violence, Mr. Netanyahu has reiterated commitment to the status quo.In this chaotic situation, the question is whether Mr. Netanyahu can rein in the violence, let alone the embattled Mr. Abbas. I doubt it - instead, we may be in for more bloodshed., Are you ready for the revolution?There is a reason Justin Trudeau received rock-star treatment in Davos, where the rich and brainy gathered at the World Economic Forum to talk about all that ails this planet. Mr. Trudeau speaks the language of the future but, unlike many of the others who gathered in the Swiss Alps last month to discuss humankind's greatest problems, he's in a position to do something about it. And he will.There's not a file on Mr. Trudeau's desk more important than climate change. And a generation of Canadians is relieved that, finally, someone in Ottawa is prepared to do something about the issue. When it came to fossil fuels, Stephen Harper's philosophy was: Burn, baby, burn. Not so his young successor; nor the coterie of eco-warriors with whom he's surrounded himself. (Top adviser Gerald Butts was head of World Wildlife Fund Canada not that long ago.)If Mr. Trudeau can't make meaningful moves on the climate file, no one can. At the moment, his popularity is as high as ever. And he will use some of that political capital to usher in the most substantive measures the nation has yet known to combat rising greenhouse gas emissions. This is a subject you'll be hearing him talk a lot about it in the next while.While not announced officially, Mr. Trudeau will convene a first ministers meeting in Vancouver in the first week of March to discuss a national climate strategy. This is a follow-up to the non-binding commitments made by Canada in Paris last December, where Environment Minister Catherine McKenna endorsed a call to hold global warming to no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels. (This was bolder than the U.S., which has maintained a 2 C target).While in Vancouver, Mr. Trudeau will give a keynote speech at the Globe 2016 conference on sustainability, which will be taking place at the same time. This is no accident. Vancouver is a favourite rendezvous for gatherings of the enlightened; it embodies what many believe the future will look like - bike lanes rivalling roadways, electricity supplied by low-carbon generators. Mr. Trudeau would love to Vancouverize the entire country if he could. Meantime, he'll have to make do with seeking input from those key players in Mayor Gregor Robertson's office who have helped make the city the eco-dream it's becoming.Before all that happens, there will be a February TED conference in Vancouver, billed as a week to 'stare hard at humanity's toughest challenges.' There is a heavy push being made to get global philanthropist Bill Gates to come and talk about the Breakthrough Energy Coalition he is part of with a group of like-minded billionaires. The coalition has committed $2-billion to fund early-stage, clean-energy companies. What it is hoping for is a moon shot - that single revelation that solves the climate change predicament.Mr. Trudeau has been so impressed by Mr. Gates' idea that he has asked his staff to investigate the idea of Canada joining in to help fund research that might one day find a solution for this planetary scourge.In March, the Prime Minister will visit the White House. Again, the agenda will be dominated by climate.By summer, it should be evident to all that the Liberal government is not going to be content to merely talk a good game on climate, but it will take action too. The billions of dollars it will soon commit nationally to transit-related infrastructure is part of this.Mr. Trudeau's ambitions will not be realized without some fights. By the first ministers meeting next month, for instance, the provinces will not likely have agreed to a national price on carbon. The Prime Minister's Office is getting major push-back from some provinces, including British Columbia, which has had a modest carbon tax in place for some time and feels it has done its part.Mr. Trudeau has been heartened by the radical environmental transformation that Rachel Notley is bringing to Alberta, of all places. If it can happen there, it can happen anywhere. If the provinces don't want to play along, however, Mr. Trudeau will have to take the gloves off. There is already talk of imposing a national carbon tax if that's what it takes.Don't think he's serious? Just watch him., That Conservative Leader Stephen Harper dislikes the media is well known.Perhaps less well known, except to hard-core Conservative supporters, is how his party beats up on the press to raise money and how successful this appeal has been.For example, before the Aug. 6 leaders' debate, the party sent a letter to its supporters urging contributions. 'Why?' asked party president John Walsh in the letter. 'Because already you're seeing the professional Harper critics and left-wing press pundits striving to pre-dispose public opinion and shape the post-debate public reaction their way - long before the first word is spoken!'Phrases such as the 'chattering class' and 'anti-Conservative media bubble' and 'media pundits on the left' adorn the letter. But Mr. Walsh likes variations on the theme of 'liberal media,' as in the 'liberal media filter' and 'liberals in the Canadian media,' people presumably working assiduously and deliberately to 'risk Canada's future to the left, far left or extreme left zealots.'To help the beleaguered Mr. Harper withstand these media assaults, Mr. Walsh urged recipients of the letter not just to send money to the party but to write letters to the editor, and to post comments on Facebook and Twitter to 'balance out the biased opinion columnists who oppose a Conservative Majority Government.' Please send a special $100 (or more) donation, Mr. Walsh said, to help launch a 'pro Conservative media blitz immediately after the debate,' because Conservatives cannot allow opponents to 'dominate the airwaves.'Speaking of dominating the airwaves, which party spent hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars advertising its policies such as those loosely associated with the Economic Action Plan? Which one began before the election campaign a radio and television campaign denigrating Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau? And which party called an early election so that it could spend more money than the others, especially during the final week of the campaign with an unprecedented media buy?All these efforts were from Mr. Walsh's party, but to read his letter the untutored might believe the Conservatives are indeed being outspent by their opponents. Worse, they are being done in by 'liberal media' whose tentacles have wrapped themselves around the country's collective brain and warped it against the Conservatives.All is fair, one might say, in love, war and elections, so this sort of Walshian hyperbole might be expected. As, perhaps, also might be the photographs in the letter of Mr. Harper smiling, NDP Leader Thomas Mulcair looking like the devil possessed and Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau sporting a moustache and looking like a cross between Zorro and Lothario.New Democrats and Liberals send messages to their supporters warning about Mr. Harper, even demonizing him, and of course rounding on his government's policies. They, too, entreat their supporters to send more money because, contrary to Conservative claims of being outspent, they know the Conservatives do indeed have more money.What differentiates the Conservative appeals is not attacking the other parties and warning of their nefarious policies, but the idea that there are other institutions, elitist ones such as the 'liberal media,' that are out to undermine the Conservative Party and conservatism. The fight is therefore not merely partisan politics, but against wider forces.Of course, political parties have been known to spar with, and even dislike, the media. Liberals under prime minister Pierre Trudeau thought their party got a raw deal, especially after all but two newspapers in English-speaking Canada endorsed the Conservatives in the 1980 election - which the Liberals then won.New Democrats historically considered the media hostile, owned by capitalists who decried socialism of every hue. Take The Toronto Star, a defiantly Liberal newspaper, out of the picture, and it's hard to see a print media conspiracy against the Conservatives. But that's the way they see the world, facts notwithstanding.As for private television, it's difficult to discern any pro- or anti-Conservative bias in a systematic way, although as everyone in the media knows, bias is often in the eye of the beholder. AM radio is overwhelmingly conservative, as any consumer of open-line shows knows. As for social media, from which many younger people now get their information, it's all over the map politically speaking.But conjuring up the enemy of the 'liberal media' has worked for the Harper Conservatives, so to that well they return., Derek H. Burney was Canada's ambassador to the U.S. from 1989-1993. Fen Osler Hampson is a distinguished fellow and director of Global Security at the Centre for International Governance Innovation and a Chancellor's Professor at Carleton University. They are the authors of Brave New Canada: Meeting the Challenge of a Changing World.The world is highly volatile and Canada's prime-minister-designate will quickly confront a series of challenges to our national interests. As the harsh global realities and potentially combustible situations assert centre stage, nostalgic sentiments about peacekeeping and United Nations-centred multilateralism will not provide much of a prescription for relevance or effect.As Henry Kissinger pointed out last week in The Wall Street Journal, the geopolitical order of the past 40 years is in shambles. Following his essentially unchallenged dismemberment of Ukraine, Russian President Vladimir Putin is now, for the first time, engaging militarily in a political and security vacuum in the Middle East. He intends to become the regional kingmaker, supplanting the United States. Mr. Kissinger rightly says that Islamic State now poses the greatest immediate threat to stability, and its destruction 'is more urgent than the overthrow of Bashar al-Assad, who has already lost over half of the area he once controlled.'But the U.S.-led coalition effort against IS is in disarray. Prime-minister-designate Justin Trudeau has signalled a 'responsible' withdrawal from the combat mission against IS, and given the meagre results of the mission to date, that may not be too difficult to finesse. But it will do little to eradicate the terrorist menace. Along with the cancellation of Canada's participation in the Joint Strike Fighter program, this recall will not sit well in Washington, and will not square with Mr. Trudeau's statements that Canada seeks deeper and closer relations with the U.S.Mr. Trudeau's formal debut on the world stage will come at the G20 Leaders Summit in Turkey on Nov. 15. He will get a first-hand glimpse at the refugee crisis that is engulfing and threatening to destabilize the social and political fabric of Europe. That gathering will be followed in rapid succession by the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meetings in Manila Nov. 18-19.Mr. Trudeau will then head to Paris for the UN climate change conference that begins Nov. 30. He promised that he would convene a First Ministers meeting to iron out Canada's position before Paris, but time is short, and forging a national consensus on meaningful carbon reductions is a tall order. Canada should not repeat the mistake it made at the Kyoto climate summit many years ago, which was to agree to hastily improvised targets without calculating the costs or consequences of implementation. Given the fragile state of the Canadian economy and the weak price of oil, which the International Energy Agency forecasts will remain low throughout 2016, Mr. Trudeau will also have to act prudently.But it is the bilateral agenda with Washington that will be Mr. Trudeau's most immediate challenge. High on the list is the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement, signed by the outgoing Harper government; Mr. Trudeau will now be privy to the details. He will have to decide sooner rather than later that this is an agreement that he is prepared to endorse. If ratified - an open question in Washington - it will supersede NAFTA, and there is no going back.Mr. Trudeau also confronts a list of thorny, bilateral irritants - U.S. restrictions on Canadian beef and on softwood lumber (the latest accord expired on Oct. 12), and Buy American provisions that discriminate against Canadian manufacturers. His challenge is not simply to change the tone of Ottawa's dealings with Washington, but also to get Washington to change its own behaviour. If, as expected, Mr. Obama vetoes the Keystone XL pipeline, which Mr. Trudeau openly supports, that will become his problem. He would be wise to counter such a veto with a full endorsement of the Energy East pipeline that would at least give our oil exports more than a single, discount market. Americans understand leverage more than sentiment.The prime-minister-designate would be well advised to initiate a strategic outreach to China in part to achieve a similar objective.On the campaign trail, Mr. Trudeau was a stunning success. But his energy, determination, sunny disposition and skills as a boxer will be even more in demand now. Foreign policy is a contact sport, and one that requires a clear strategy to win. As Sugar Ray Leonard once said, 'I was painfully initiated into boxing, because the guys I fought were a lot bigger than me.' Welcome to the global ring, Mr. Trudeau, and, above all, don't lead with your chin., Naila Keleta-Mae is a professor at the University of Waterloo where she researches race, gender, theatre and performance.Some people are livid that Black Lives Matter staged a 30 minute sit-in at Pride Toronto's marquee parade on Sunday afternoon.Pride Toronto is the status quo in terms of representations of lesbian, gay, bisexual, queer and transgender communities in Toronto and the front-line activism that organizations like Black Lives Matter engage in isn't intended to comfort or reaffirm the status quo.The undercurrent of much of the anger and frustration about Black Lives Matter's latest action is the perceived audacity of the membership to use the platform of their Honour Group status at Pride Toronto to publicly and dramatically critique Pride Toronto.But when we think that any of our institutions - from LGBTQ organizations to police forces - are beyond scrutiny and public reproach then history tells us we have entered dangerous territory.Canada has a violent history that is fraught with painful examples of what can happen when large institutions go unchecked; even well-meaning ones that are full of good intentions.Black Lives Matter, a grassroots chapter in Toronto of an activist movement that spans North America, is part of a long tradition of front-line activism that spans generations, cultures and issues.The dramatic delivery of the group's activism is intended to unsettle the majority and empower minorities. In the space opened by its activism, different groups of people are emboldened and different groups of people are silenced - even if only for a moment. That is the point.The group's demands are always lofty and its tactics are always attention-grabbing: from shutting down the Allen Expressway, to building a tent city in front of Toronto Police Services headquarters, to bringing a letter printed in large format to City Hall for city councillors to read.Do their tactics expose already vulnerable communities to more vulnerability? Yes. Is their activism a sign of progress? Absolutely.For some, progress looks like increased police presence, the first ever sitting Prime Minister marching in the parade, and heterosexual people at Pride wearing stickers that read 'Ally.' For some, progress looks like the list of demands that Black Lives Matter issued to Pride Toronto, things like: 'self-determination for all community spaces,' 'a commitment to increase representation amongst Pride Toronto staffing/hiring,' and 'double funding for Blockorama + ASL interpretation & headliner funding.'For others, progress is a combination of these things. Progress is messy. Progress is fought for and fought over, especially when it takes into account the perspectives of a wide and disparate range of people.But anger from the masses seems to be really centred on one thing: Black Lives Matter's demand for 'the removal of police floats/booths in all Pride marches/parades/community spaces.'The irony of people rising up in 2016 to defend the police presence at Pride Toronto lies in the organization's history. When Pride Toronto started in 1981 it was as a riot against 150 police officers who raided gay bathhouses and arrested more than 300 men. The foundation of what is now known as Pride Toronto was essentially a sit-in. It was a protest. Thirty-five years later, Black Lives Matter staged a sit-in at the sit-in. They advocated within an advocacy group and that is familiar terrain for black people who have participated in social justice movements for generations across North America. There is a long history of grassroots black activists advocating for the concerns of marginalized people within mainstream efforts for equality across the continent.Front-line activism rarely feels good for those whose lives and worldviews are interrupted or inconvenienced by public demonstrations of dissent.But it is not the job of grassroots activists to make those who condone their marginalization and oppression to feel as though everything is fine.Many have focused on the appropriateness and efficacy of the organization's tactics, but the real question is this: How will Pride Toronto's leadership respond?In many ways, that is always the most important question whenever the mainstream is challenged because the response indicates the vision the organization has for itself and for the communities it represents.For that reason, Pride Toronto's response is precisely what we should pay close attention to in the months and years to come., The moment the judge issued his not-guilty verdict in the Jian Ghomeshi case last week, the wailing and gnashing of teeth began. A public opinion poll found that most Torontonians (especially women) thought he should have been convicted. Many people said their faith in the justice system had been shaken.The case has been so polarizing that some people can't discuss it with their friends. 'I agree with the verdict but I have to keep my opinion to myself,' one woman told me. Others who spoke up have been promptly unfriended. Being outraged about the Ghomeshi case is a way of signalling your general outrage about the justice system, which, we're told, is grotesquely unfair to sexual assault victims.All this outrage is a tribute to the #IBelieveSurvivors lobby, which has been extremely successful at spreading its message that victims are not believed, that witnesses are held to impossible standards and that men get away with it just as they always have. Its loaded language has elevated sexual assault to the level of wars and natural disasters.Yet, according to many people who work in the system, this picture is basically untrue. The facts may surprise you. They certainly surprised me. Here is what I've learned.1. Police almost always lay a charge when a woman complains of sexual assault, especially in Toronto and other large cities, lawyers told me. The consequences aren't trivial. The alleged abuser may be arrested. He may spend a night in jail awaiting bail. He will be forbidden to have any contact with the complainant. He may have to move out from a shared residence.2. False allegations are not rare. 'Sadly, they happen all the time' says defence lawyer Kathryn Wells. 'It may be revenge, jealousy, payback for cheating, any number of things. Men lie, too.' In no area of life are we expected to believe some people, unconditionally. There's no reason why sexual assault should be an exception.3. The conviction rate for sexual assault cases is relatively high. In 2013-14, the latest year reported by Statistics Canada, 3,002 cases of sexual assault were presented to courts across Canada. In many cases, charges were withdrawn or stayed (typically because the Crown did not believe there was enough evidence to convict). Of the 1,626 cases that resulted in a judicial decision, there were 1,357 guilty verdicts and 269 acquittals.4. The range of behaviour covered by the legal term 'sexual assault' is extremely wide. It includes anything from a poke on the buttocks, to rape at knife point.Because of the massive publicity and inflated rhetoric that surrounded the Ghomeshi case, many people are likely under the impression that the allegations were far more serious than they were. Choking, punching, slapping and hair pulling are all criminal offences, to be sure. But the alleged assaults were of short duration and did not result in injuries. When they learned the details of the allegations, several people I spoke with wondered why the case had gone to trial at all.5. Nobody expects a victim of a violent crime to be a perfect witness. That is not the standard that is expected in court. The courts make allowance for minor errors and inconsistencies in recollection. It is also by now widely accepted that women in abusive, long-term relationships have a very hard time leaving. But the courts are not obliged to abandon common sense. If a woman says she was assaulted by a man she had just met, it is legitimate to ask why she kept pursuing him even though she claims she never wanted to see him again.6. Alternatives to the current judicial process aren't so easy to come up with. Some people advocate a non-adversarial approach - perhaps something like a sentencing circle, which would allow an abuser to acknowledge the wrong he or she has done. That's all very well, but it only works when both parties agree to it, and when the accused person is willing to admit to what he did and knows he won't face further penalties.It is also worth remembering that in criminal cases, there are asymmetrical consequences for complainants and defendants. If the complainant loses, life goes on. If the defendant loses, he stands to lose his liberty, his job, his reputation and much else. That's why the standard of proof is so high. In high-profile cases, a defendant is likely to lose a lot even if he wins.7. The justice system isn't good at therapy. It can't shelter complainants from the rough-and-tumble of the adversarial process. It can't make their pain go away.It isn't perfect. But it can, quite often, deliver justice - despite what the hashtag warriors want you to believe., Only the National Capital Commission now stands between the implantation of a memorial to the victims of communism on the main ceremonial street of Ottawa and its realization.The NCC, however, is composed largely of appointees of the Harper government. They have rolled over before; they might do so again, since the government is utterly determined for political reasons to get this monument built. Biting the hand that appointed them would take rare courage.The NCC is obliged at least to listen to its design committee, chaired by Larry Beasley of Vancouver, once that city's brilliant chief planner. It is hard to imagine the design committee recommending either the memorial as contemplated, or the site. After all, the Royal Architectural Institute of Canada and the Ontario Association of Architects have objected to the site being used in this fashion.Supreme Court Chief Justice Beverley McLachlin has expressed her concerns in writing, since the prime site would sit kitty-corner to her court's building and was originally intended for a new Federal Court building. Ottawa Mayor Jim Watson has objected. So have local Liberal and NDP MPs and many independent architects and planners. Seventeen past presidents of the Canadian Bar Association have also objected.In the face of this lineup of distinguished people and institutions, the commission would have to swallow hard to approve the design. Its hands are partly tied, however, since a previous NCC board acquiesced in the change of land use for a memorial, which is what a private group proposed and is now executing with increasingly large sums of public money to supplement its own private fundraising.Let's cut to the chase. This monument will happen, unless the government is defeated in the fall election. And even then, shovels might strike the ground before the vote, making its cancellation difficult.The Prime Minister wants it done, period. Even if the NCC recommends against the memorial, the cabinet can overrule the NCC. And it will, despite howls from people who a) don't like the government, b) don't like the memorial, or c) both. The howls will be from the 'elites' - architects, planners, media, judges and municipal officials.Praise will come from the intended political targets of the memorial: individuals and descendants of those who fled communist regimes, especially in Eastern Europe. Poles, Ukrainians, Czechs, Hungarians and people with lineage to the Baltic states are the target groups.The Conservatives have worked very hard to attract these voters by other means, and the memorial represents a further tangible demonstration of the party's efforts. That the memorial has nothing central to say about Canadian history, per se, but rather of diaspora histories is irrelevant. There is political targeting going on, which could be seen in the extensive publicity given to the various announcements of the memorial's creation.The more this government is attacked for something, the stronger its determination to proceed. We are seeing this now with the anti-terrorism legislation, Bill C-51, and we saw the same reaction last year when just about everyone in civic society, including the Chief Electoral Officer, opposed portions of suggested unilateral changes to the Fair Elections Act.The minister who supervised that act and then stonewalled for so long was Pierre Poilievre, who, by virtue of former minister John Baird's resignation, is now the leading minister for Ottawa. Predictably, he has brushed off opposition to the memorial, saying his constituents prefer it to another downtown office building., A surprising number of people have responded to the bloody slaughter in Paris by saying we shouldn't have riled them up. 'I don't condone murder,' the argument goes, 'but it's wrong to provoke people by insulting their religion.'So, what about the slaughter of Jewish shoppers in the kosher supermarket? What did the Jews do to rile them up?Well, some people know. Gaza, etc. Nothing justifies the slaughter of innocent civilians, of course, but Israel's atrocities are also a provocation.In fact, for large parts of the world, Israel's very existence is a provocation. And for Islamists, killing Jews is God's work.'As far as I am concerned, I feel I am Charlie Coulibaly,' declared Dieudonne, the anti-Semitic French comedian, on his Facebook page. He was referring to terrorist Amedy Coulibaly, who gunned down four Jews at a kosher supermarket. Dieudonne, whose appearances and videos feature long rants against Israel and the Jewish lobby, is wildly popular among young French North Africans.Since the attacks in France, a lot of people have been warning about a backlash against Muslims that could strengthen Europe's far right and possibly create a new brand of neo-Nazi threat. But the real threat to Europe comes from the kind of angry, disaffected young Muslims who regard Dieudonne as a hero.France's leaders are now speaking bluntly about this. Prime Minister Manuel Valls declared Saturday that France is now at war against radical Islam. 'There is a new anti-Semitism in France,' he told The Atlantic's Jeffrey Goldberg. 'We have the old anti-Semitism, and I'm obviously not downplaying it, that comes from the extreme right, but this new anti-Semitism comes from the difficult neighbourhoods, from immigrants from the Middle East and North Africa, who have turned anger about Gaza into something very dangerous. Israel and Palestine are just a pretext. There is something far more profound taking place now.'France's Jewish population of about 500,000 is less than 1 per cent of the country's population. Yet Jews are all too often targeted by hate crimes, many of which are committed by Muslims. In 2012, seven people, including three children, were gunned down by Mohammed Merah, an anti-Semitic French citizen of Algerian extraction. Last year, four people were killed at the Jewish Museum in Belgium, allegedly by a French national. Last summer, a pro-Palestinian mob torched Jewish shops in the Paris suburb of Sarcelles. By comparison, hate crimes against Muslims are relatively minor, mostly crimes against property.On a recent tour of synagogues in Le Marais, the old Jewish quarter of Paris, I asked some of our guides about the future for Jews in France. They were pessimistic. Thousands of Jews have left in recent years and the exodus is increasing. In the wake of the terrorist attacks, France has sent 10,000 troops to guard Jewish schools and synagogues and other sites, but they can't guard everybody all the time. And they can't change the minds of the fanatical young men who have embraced Islamic extremism. That will take a revolution within Islam itself.'I say and repeat, again, that we are in need of a religious revolution,' Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi declared on New Year's Day. 'You imams are responsible before Allah. The entire world is waiting on you. The entire world is waiting for your word ... because the Islamic world is being torn, it is being destroyed, it is being lost. And it is being lost by our own hands.'But even if it comes, the revolution against extremism is going to take a while. Meantime, Mr. Valls is tragically correct: We're at war., The United States and its NATO allies, including Canada, are embarking on an attempt to remake the Middle East - or, rather, to unmake that which has been remade.Wednesday night, U.S. President Barack Obama will explain to his countrymen why his country and others will attempt to defeat the Islamic State movement, which has taken over a third of Syria and a quarter of Iraq, creating a fanatical Sunni regime.With military swiftness and a savage ideology, the Islamic State became the dominant force opposing the Syrian government, and set the Iraqi army to flight. That army, on which the North Atlantic Treaty Organization now places considerable faith, literally disappeared from the battlefield, leaving behind its modern weapons for the Islamist forces.The Americans will now try, with the help of others, to restore the territorial integrity of both Iraq and Syria - without sending in ground troops of their own, an ambition that exceeds the chosen means.They will count on air power and the armies of the Kurdish and Shia portions of Iraq for a military effort that must last a long time and offers very long odds of success. To this unfolding venture, Canada has already committed several dozen special-operations troops, vague promises of further help and a highly publicized (in Canada) trip to Baghdad by Foreign Minister John Baird and two opposition party critics, during which Canada pledged political fidelity and a little financial support to a deeply corrupt government in a deeply divided country.Even if the Islamic State, formerly known as the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), is pushed back militarily, it's likely that Syria's civil war will continue to rage and Iraq will continue to be beset by political instability.These somewhat artificial states, carved out by secret Anglo-French manipulations after the First World War, were held together by autocrats and cabals. One autocrat, Iraq's Saddam Hussein, is gone. Another, Syria's Bashar al-Assad, remains.The Islamic State has exploited power vacuums in both countries, as well as fierce religious animosities. Outsiders barely understand these schisms, but will be expected to navigate them in the months and years ahead, now that they've plunged back into the region.Colin Powell, who was U.S. secretary of state under president George W. Bush, once remarked (referring to Iraq) that if you break the crockery, you own it. What supporters of the 2003 invasion hoped to own was a grateful Iraqi populace and a government committed to power-sharing among Shiites, Sunnis and Kurds.None of those hopes was realized, because Americans, as is their wont, assumed that their norms and values would be embraced by others without experience living with them. Instead, the majority Shiites, suddenly in power in Baghdad, excluded and persecuted the previously ruling Sunnis. The Kurds, seeing the weakening of the Iraqi state, reach in to grab control of territory and power they had long coveted. That they can co-exist happily now strains credulity.Mr. Bush's administration justified that war with, among other lies, the idea that al-Qaeda had influence and exercised power in Iraq. Today, the Islamic State controls great swaths of Sunni territory in Iraq. It is more ruthless, and certainly better organized, than al-Qaeda ever was.As Patrick Cockburn recently wrote in the London Review of Books (and as Mr. Harper, Mr. Baird and anyone else interested in the travails ahead should read): 'For America, Britain and the Western powers, the rise of ISIL and the caliphate is the ultimate disaster. Whatever they intended by their invasion of Iraq in 2003 and their efforts to get rid of Assad in Syria since 2011, it was not to see the creation of a jihadi state spanning northern Iraq and Syria run by a movement a hundred times bigger and better organized than the al-Qaeda of Osama bin Laden.'To these complications must also be added the assorted ambitions of the Iranians, the Saudis, the Qataris and to a lesser extent the Turks, who play favourites among the factions in Syria and Iraq, and resort to duplicitousness with outsiders when it suits their purposes, which is often.With dubious populaces at home, regional allies of uncertain commitment, evident gaps between means and ambitions, and unfocused long-term objectives, we will try to remake that which has already been remade., What happens when your son tells you he's really a girl?Twenty years ago, you probably would have crossed your fingers and tried to wait it out. Today, you might buy him a whole new wardrobe, find someone to prescribe hormone blockers, and help him live as a girl. Maybe he'll even become a celebrity. A recent Maclean's magazine cover, posing that very question, featured a lovely 11-year-old with long, flowing locks and enormous eyes. His name used to be Oliver.Suddenly transgender kids are everywhere - in the news, on Dr. Phil and in your neighbourhood. School boards have developed detailed transgender policies. Clinics to treat transgender kids have sprung up. A condition that used to be vanishingly rare, perhaps one in 10,000 children or less, now seems common. In a random sampling of 6th- to 8th-graders in San Francisco, kids were asked if they identified as male, female or transgendered - 1.3 per cent checked off the transgendered box.What's going on? To find out, I sat down with Dr. Ken Zucker, one of the world's foremost authorities on gender identity issues in children and adolescents. As head of the Gender Identity Service at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health in Toronto, he has worked with hundreds of kids like Olie.'The No. 1 factor is the Internet,' he said. 'If you're struggling to find out where you fit, the Internet is filled with things about gender dysphoria.''When we ask, 'When did you first learn about this label of gender dysphoria', they'll say, 'Me and Mom watched Oprah,' ' adds Dr. Hayley Wood, a member of his team.Gender dysphoria (formerly known as gender identity disorder) means being at odds with your biological sex. It's not the same as being born with ambivalent genitalia, or being gay. The popular shorthand is 'being born in the wrong body,' although that formulation probably does more harm than good. Sex-reassignment treatment is appropriate for some (although by no means all) adults who are unhappy with their gender identity, and some go on to live significantly happier lives.But for kids, especially younger ones, the issue is much more problematic. Gender confusion is often temporary. About three-quarters of little kids who have issues with their gender - boys who want to be princesses, girls who throw their dresses in the garbage - will be comfortable with it by adolescence, according to Dr. Zucker. (Many of them will grow up to be gay or bi.) Gender confusion can also be a handy label for whatever ails a child (or her family). That's why Dr. Zucker takes a watch-and-wait approach. He even advises parents of princessy six-year-olds to say, 'You're not a girl. You're a boy.'And in the hotly politicized world of gender politics, that makes him, in many people's eyes, a dangerous reactionary. They argue that a child's identity must be honoured, and that treatment should start sooner rather than later. They equate the watch-and-wait approach with the widely discredited practice of reparative therapy, which was a failed effort to turn gay kids straight. With the advent of powerful new drugs that delay puberty, the stakes in this debate are even higher. Start them early on puberty-blocking drugs, and their eventual transition will be easier. But which kids? What if you're pushing them on a path they don't need to go down? At what point do you start taking life-altering decisions for a child that will have enormous physical, social and emotional consequences?Alice Dreger is a bioethicist and professor at Northwestern University's Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago. She calls herself an (im)patient advocate who prefers evidence to ideology. She is a strong supporter of transgender rights. But she thinks the pendulum has swung too far.One reason is that social norms have dramatically changed. It is now fashionable to embrace your diverse child. Parents who encourage their kids to change gender 'are socially rewarded as wonderful and accepting,' while parents who try to take it slow 'are seen as unaccepting, lacking in affection and conservative,' she says.These days, parents who don't like the slow-and-careful answer can shop for another one. Ms. Dreger is highly critical of what she calls the 'hasty clinics,' which are happy to help a kid transition right away. 'Parents don't like uncertainty,' she says. 'They'd rather be told, 'Here's the diagnosis, and it's all gonna turn out fine.'' Teenagers can find fast help, too. Plenty of doctors are happy to help them out with hormone treatments just for the asking.For some people, including some adolescents, transgender treatment is lifesaving. But these treatments are neither simple nor benign. They may, among other things, retard maturation, suppress your growth or render you sterile. And in the end, medical science cannot create a body that makes you forget you were born the other sex. 'Some kids need it, but for the kids who don't, it's dangerous,' she says. 'All else being equal, it's better to avoid long-term hormone therapy and major surgery that removes a lot of tissue.'Disturbingly, data on long-term outcomes for transgender kids are scarce. No one is tracking the evidence on puberty-blocking intervention either. 'We are doing major interventions and we have shockingly little idea what the outcomes are,' Ms. Dreger says. You get the sense that what we have is not so much a rational approach to a psychosocial issue as a radical ideological experiment.Here's more unwelcome news from Ms. Dreger. A child's gender issue may merely be a symptom of other family problems. 'The dirty little secret is that many of these families have big dysfunctional issues. When you get the clinicians over a beer, they'll tell you the truth. A lot of the parents aren't well in terms of their mental health. They think that once the child transitions, all their problems will magically go away, but that's not really where the stress is located.' Clinicians won't say these things publicly, she says, because they don't want to sound as if they're blaming gender problems on screwed-up families.It's a mark of social progress that we are increasingly willing to accept people on their terms, for who they are. But maybe we're manufacturing more problems than we're solving. If we really want to help people, we should remember the old rule: First, do no harm., I'm not overly invested in the marijuana debate. My friends and I all smoked pot when we were young, but hardly any of us bother any more. In my circle, the drugs of choice are martinis and Chardonnay. Frankly, we consider stoners declasse.That doesn't mean pot laws are of no concern to the upper middle class. Quite a lot of parents I know have been forced to shell out $10,000 or $15,000 to make sure their kid didn't acquire a criminal record simply for having a joint in his pocket. Less affluent kids are less likely to get off the hook, so clearly there's a social-justice issue here.Which brings us to Justin Trudeau, who struck a bold blow for social justice this week when he declared that it's time to stop stalling and legalize pot once and for all. It's a position most Canadians agree with, so it's not bad politics. At last - a bright line in the sand between the forces of enlightened common sense, as embodied by the younger generation (Mr. Trudeau), and the forces of ignorance and repression, as embodied by out-of-touch, old white Conservatives! Is there any doubt whose side you'd rather be on?Well, there might just be a little doubt. The battle over pot is a classic culture war, generating a lot of heat and very little light, with plenty of myth and misinformation on both sides. Legalizing marijuana wouldn't be the road to moral ruin. But it wouldn't solve all our problems either.Like a lot of people, Mr. Trudeau seems to think that once we legalize marijuana, everything will be the same, but without arrests. In fact, he says our kids will be even safer. 'Tax it. Regulate it,' he said this week. 'It's one of the only ways to keep it out of the hands of our kids.'Fat chance. Simple logic says he's wrong. When people want something and you make it easier to get, demand generally goes up. Especially if the price goes down. And the price of legal marijuana would go way down. It would likely be the cheapest high on a per-hour basis of all the common drugs, including beer - even if it's heavily taxed. That's because marijuana is ridiculously inexpensive to produce. It could probably be grown on a commercial basis for less than $25 a pound. That's less than 1 per cent of the current street price (about $200 an ounce in Vancouver, according to PriceofWeed.com).I'm not trying to be snarky. I'm just pointing out the facts. On the whole, marijuana isn't very dangerous, and arresting people for possession is ludicrous. But Mr. Trudeau must be smoking something if he thinks legalizing pot would decrease consumption. Of course it wouldn't! Legalizing alcohol didn't decrease consumption either.In fact, the evidence, such as it is, suggests that legalization would likely double or triple marijuana use. That doesn't mean we shouldn't do it. We just shouldn't kid ourselves.It's hard to find experts who are objective about drug policy, especially in Canada, where the conversation has been hopelessly polarized between the law-and-order crowd and the legalize-everything gang (very popular in B.C.).The most trustworthy source I've found is Mark Kleiman, professor of public policy at the UCLA School of Public Affairs and a lifelong student of drug policy. The facts I'm citing here are drawn from a valuable book he co-authored, Marijuana Legalization: What Everyone Needs to Know. Mr. Kleiman is now the newly appointed pot czar of the state of Washington, which recently voted to legalize marijuana. His job is to help Washingtonians do it well, not stupidly, and to learn as they go.Ask Mr. Kleiman for a cost-benefit analysis of legalizing pot, and he'll say it all depends. 'Any honest assessment of the situation needs to acknowledge uncertainty,' he wrote recently. That's because, contrary to popular belief, 'there is currently no legal commercial (non-medical) production and distribution system for marijuana anywhere in the world.'Mr. Kleiman busts some other myths held dear by legalizers. For one, the revenues from taxing pot wouldn't be all that great, because even with a big increase in demand, marijuana is not that big a business. Nor would legalization in the U.S. drive the Mexican drug cartels out of business. That's because pot doesn't account for very much of their business, maybe 20 per cent. The real money's in hard drugs. The number of young men in jail would definitely go down - especially in the United States, which has been far harsher than Canada on drug crime. But the number of young adult potheads would definitely go up.Mr. Kleiman warns that business interests would certainly try to hijack the industry, just as they have with alcohol. He points out that in California, the medical-marijuana business is an open joke - anyone can get a prescription from certain doctors, and most of them aren't sick. Meantime, the widely touted medical benefits of cannabis are still unproven, partly because governments have blocked proper scientific testing.There would, of course, be lots of immediate benefits to legalization. Police officers would have to find something else to do. Defence lawyers would have to turn in their Porsches. But before we rush into this, maybe we should watch and learn from the experiment in Washington.'We have to use evidence and science to make sure we're moving forward,' Mr. Trudeau said the other day. I agree. Now if only he would follow his own advice., Dr. Brian Goldman is a Toronto ER physician and author of The Secret Language of Doctors.When I was asked to give the keynote to graduates of the class of '14, it was an honour that nevertheless filled me with terror and a bit of wistfulness.My sense of fear in giving advice to these amazing young doctors comes from not being sure I belong in the same company. They are whip smart, talented, and ambitious beyond anything I could muster. The competition for a place in med school is past daunting; out of 3,000 wannabes, just 250 make the cut. The thought crossed my mind that if I was starting out today, I'm not at all sure I'd make the class.The wistfulness comes from wondering whether I would want to be a member of the class of '14 if I had the opportunity. These are trying times for young doctors.An editorial in the most recent edition of the Canadian Medical Association Journal puts the rate of burnout among residents as high as 50 per cent - with symptoms such as emotional and physical exhaustion, a detached attitude, and a belief that they can no longer work effectively with patients.The path to burnout in these young doctors is often set years before the first symptoms appear.The medical profession attracts bright people with personality traits like perfectionism and a martyr complex. The academic demands of being a doctor are quite high. And as these students become residents, the work demands are even higher.Just take a trip through the hospital. The patients we treat are older, sicker and more complex. Today's residents must grasp more and do more each day than ever before. Technology fixes some problems and creates others.To that, add sleepless nights. We all know that sleep deprivation can't be good for a resident's diagnostic acumen. A recent front-page story in The Globe and Mail documented the mixed results reducing those hours have on the well-being of residents and of their patients.When it comes to taking care of the emotional well-being of residents (and each other), we're downright stingy.Once students and residents have completed their last oral and written examinations, they may never receive any other feedback about their competence, let alone that that they do good work.With nearly three decades under my belt, I can say with complete confidence that it's possible to go years without hearing anyone in authority say you're doing well.As well, we don't do a good job helping the resident or practising physician work through and learn from the medical mistakes that are inevitable given the complexity of medicine today. Blame for failing to diagnose a heart attack - a discredited approach in other high-stakes enterprises such as commercial aviation - is still the default approach to error in medicine.All that, plus a series of firsts that test a young doctor's ability to keep in balance emotionally. The exhilaration of a first solo birth or a first save is beyond description. Then again, there's the fallout of emotionally charged events such as the first unanticipated death and the first time you have to ask a substitute decision-maker to agree to a Do Not Attempt Resuscitation order.Some firsts make us glad we became physicians; others make us question our choice. These young doctors will see things and may be asked to do things that put their personal moral code to the test. The experts call that moral distress, and it's considered yet another risk factor for depression and burnout - both of which lead to more errors - and the beginnings of a vicious cycle.The human cost of burnout is almost unfathomable. Health professionals with burnout make more mistakes and their patients are at greater risk of being injured as a result of their errors. There's also a good chance the patient who is going through a traumatic event like the loss of a loved won't get emotional support because the burned out doctor doesn't have any to provide.Even more troubling are the rates of depression that some of us feel. The number one cause of death among physicians age 35 and younger is suicide.One may wonder how a profession as ethically grounded as doctoring has so much trouble taking care of its own. I think it's time we recognized that, collectively, we bear responsibility for the current state of affairs.More accurately, the medical culture that fosters us is the problem. It's a culture that implies you should strive to be perfect even though you're human - one that encourages you to run from your feelings even though you can't hide from them.There is no MRI that can peer into the doctor's emotional core. There's no clot-busting drug that can unblock the way there. But inward we must look, for the sake of those who just joined our ranks - and ours.This is adapted from a keynote address Brian Goldman gave earlier this month to the graduating medical class at the University of Toronto., It's too much to ask, apparently, that female athletes at the 2016 Olympic Games are treated like - wait for it - athletes.Like human beings of jaw-dropping physical achievement who have made untold sacrifices to run, jump, swim, score and compete. As jocks, basically, focused on taking home gold.Nope. From the very start, this year's Olympics coverage has been an annoying replay of every boring sexist comment ever made about women and sports.When NBC announced last month that it would delay its stream of the opening ceremonies by an hour, outlets such as The Philadelphia Inquirer asked why. John Miller, the chief marketing officer of the channel's Games coverage, responded by saying that Olympics viewers are more likely to be women than men, and are therefore not 'particularly sports fans.'In photos: Triumph, tears and the plain tenacity of Canada's Olympic athletes'They're less interested in the result and more interested in the journey,' he explained. 'It's sort of like the ultimate reality show and mini-series wrapped into one.'Things only got dumber from there.Peter Mansbridge called Gisele Bundchen 'Mrs. Tom Brady' during CBC's opening-ceremony broadcast; clearly Uncle Canada hasn't heard that the Brazilian super model is probably worth twice as much as the football guy.American trapshooter Cory Cogdell won her second Games medal only to have the Chicago Tribune describe her in a tweet as the 'wife of a Bears lineman,' which will never, ever happen to Bill even if Hillary wins.'Pretty Penny' blared a Toronto Sun headline about Canada's silver butterfly medallist, lest 16-year-old Penny Oleksiak become confused that it's her speed, skill or commitment that matters in this world.And woe be the woman who thinks she can just up and collect medals after giving birth. After American swimmer Dana Vollmer won a silver and a bronze, the Daily Mail felt the need to point out her pregnancy weight gain (it also labelled Katie Ledecky 'the female Michael Phelps').The list goes on and the Games aren't nearly done. Even if none of this is exactly on purpose, it's not by accident either. Women playing sports has always been controversial and societies have always tried to dissuade it.As The Globe and Mail's Cathal Kelly noted recently, Victorians got their bloomers into such a knot over ladies on teams that the late 19th-century saw soccer teams chased by mobs and rugby tournaments squashed. A hundred years or so later, Saudi Arabia prevents girls and women from playing sports inside that country, but sends foreign-trained citizens to the Games to deflect criticism.In between has come the policing of women's hormone levels and bodies; the controversy about whether Sports Illustrated should have named the world's best tennis player, Serena Williams, or a horse as its 'sportsperson of the year' for 2015; and, oh yeah, the underpayment of female athletes at every level basically everywhere.It's all of a piece. So yes, silly headlines and slips of the tongue do matter. And if you make a mistake, learn how to apologize, gracefully.That's not what happened when NBC sportscaster Dan Hicks was called out for his verbiage after the women's 400-metre individual medley. After Hungarian swimmer Katinka Hosszu set a new world record, the camera panned over her husband (and coach) Shane Tusup, prompting Mr. Hicks to declare 'there's the guy responsible.' Swift derision followed on social media, so he dialled it back. A little. 'With live TV, there are often times you look back and wished you had said things differently,' Mr. Hicks said. But but but! 'It is impossible to tell Katinka's story accurately without giving appropriate credit to Shane ...'Remind me again who's focused on emotions and relationships? Seems like it's men who are preoccupied with the juicy back story while all the sportsing is going on., For the past few weeks, proven and alleged wrongdoing by several members of the Canadian Senate has preoccupied the national news media and disgusted Canadians.But while the media focus on the Senate scandals and what to do with those responsible, the bigger long-term question is what to do with the institution itself - whether to substantially reform it or abolish it altogether.Why do large federations with unevenly distributed populations - Australia, Germany, the United States, Canada - all have bicameral (two-house) parliaments or congresses? For solid geopolitical, historical and constitutional reasons that are as valid today as they were when these institutions were first established.As Abraham Lincoln put it in reference to the United States: 'The convention that framed the Constitution had this difficulty: The small states wished to so frame the government that they might be equal to the larger ones regardless of the inequality of population; the larger ones insisted on equality in proportion to population. They compromised it, by basing the House of Representatives on population and the Senate on states regardless of population ...'In Canada, of course, the same type of compromise was necessary to get the founding provinces, especially Quebec and Ontario, to agree to Confederation. But because our Senate is unelected and unaccountable to voters and taxpayers, it lacks the democratic legitimacy required to command public support for either its role as a chamber of sober second thought or its potential role as an effective champion of regional and minority interests.Making the Senate democratically accountable through the direct or indirect election of senators is the one reform that needs to be undertaken before Canadians can fairly judge whether the institution can be made sufficiently worthy and useful to justify retention, rather than abolition.On the political side, it is ironic that the strongest current advocate of Senate abolition in the federal arena is the Quebec-based NDP. In the long run, no province will need a reformed Senate more than Quebec, and when the federal New Democrats prematurely advocate Senate abolition, they are essentially repeating the same mistake they made in the West two decades ago.In the 1980s and '90s, when so-called western alienation was at its peak, championing a reformed Senate to provide more effective representation of western interests was a hot and attractive topic. The Triple-E Senate movement was born out of Calgary, advocating measures to make the Senate elected, equal and effective. Senate reform became a major vote-getting plank in the Reform Party platform, Alberta passed provincial legislation to elect Senate nominees, and Stan Waters became Canada's first 'elected Senator.'At all-candidate forums in the 1993 and 1997 elections, when western NDP candidates advocated Senate abolition, they were immediately asked: 'But how then will western interests be effectively represented in a one-house Parliament where Quebec and Ontario have an absolute majority of seats?' NDP candidates were simply unable to answer this and related questions to the satisfaction of western voters, enabling Reform, not the NDP (despite its historic roots in the West), to become the voice of western alienation and the champion of western regional interests.Today, with the rapid growth of population in the western provinces and the shift in the country's political centre of gravity from the old Laurentian region (Quebec and Ontario together) to the new alignment between Ontario and the West, Senate reform is not as high on the western agenda as it once was. It is rather the eastern provinces, especially Quebec, with its population declining in relation to the rest of the country, that will eventually be most in need of parliamentary representation that does not rest solely on population.In 1840, when the future Quebec and Ontario were joined by the Act of Union, Quebec had 58 per cent of the population of the United Province of Canada. By the time of Confederation in 1867, this proportion had slipped to less than 50 per cent and Sir John A. Macdonald offered equality between Ontario and Quebec in the newly created Senate to offset the dominance 'rep by pop' gave to Ontario in the newly created House of Commons.Today, Quebec's population is 24 per cent of that of the rest of Canada and likely to decline further in percentage terms as its economy languishes under a minority separatist provincial government. Which is why Senate reform, not abolition, is in Quebec's long-run interests and the interests of all Canadians who wish to prevent 'eastern alienation' from becoming yet another strain on the unity of the country.Preston Manning is the founder of the Manning Centre for Building Democracy., Paul Heinbecker, a former ambassador to the UN, is with the Centre for International Governance Innovation, the Balsillie School and Laurier University in WaterlooThe United Kingdom's Iraq Inquiry report reminds us once again of the folly of the Iraq war and the importance of leadership. The report explodes whatever residual justification that former Prime Minister Tony Blair and his acolytes have clung to since making themselves the all too willing accomplices of the illegal U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003.The report also reminds us of the conflict that took at least 150,000 Iraqi lives and displaced a million more, destabilizing the Middle East with the results seen today from Bagdad and Aleppo to Dhaka, Istanbul, Paris, Brussels and Orlando. It should also prompt us to contemplate what we ourselves can learn from this inquiry.A first lesson for Canada is that foreign policy decisions, especially those involving peace and war, must be guided by values as well as interests. The report makes it clear the essential purpose of the British government going into that war in Iraq was to maintain its privileged relationship with Washington. The British went along to get along. According to the chairman of the inquiry, Sir John Chilcot, Mr. Blair wrote to President George W. Bush in July 2002 with an assurance that he would be with him 'whatever.'The British deluded themselves that, in a partnership, they would be able to influence Washington's decisions. Mr. Chilcot's report has made it clear that, not surprisingly, the opposite happened. As Canada's Ambassador to the UN at that time, I witnessed the British play stalking horse for U.S. policy - not for the first time - and turn their own legal case on its head to align itself with Washington and justify the war. Nor, when war came, did U.K. efforts have much impact on U.S. behaviour, notably on the U.S. decision to disband the Iraq army, which lead to the creation of Islamic State.A second lesson Canada should draw from the report is to be wary of group-think and overly confident intelligence services. According to Chilcot, 'there was an ingrained belief in the U.K. policy and intelligence communities that Iraq had retained some chemical and biological capabilities; that it was determined to preserve and if possible enhance them - and, in the future, to acquire a nuclear capability; and that it was able to conceal its activities from the UN inspectors.'These beliefs were shared by much, though not all, of the U.S. intelligence establishment as well. The case for Iraq's having weapons of mass destruction was, in the notorious and indelible words of former CIA director George Tenet, a 'slam dunk.' U.S. Vice-President Dick Cheney said Saddam Hussein's Iraq had reconstituted its nuclear weapons. Secretary of State Colin Powell insisted to the UN Security Council that what he was presenting them were 'not assertions. [They were] facts, corroborated by many sources, some of them sources of the intelligence services of other countries.'None of these claims about Iraq turned out to be true.As one Arab ambassador to the UN warned at the time that, in attacking Iraq, the Americans, U.K. and allies had swallowed a razor blade that would be bloody, painful and costly to extract. Another Arab said that while the war would be won in six weeks, the crisis it would cause would last 60 years, and the Arab memory of it will last centuries.A third lesson we should draw from the Iraq Inquiry report is the importance of the role of the UN Security Council. According to Mr. Chilcot, 'most members of the Security Council could not be convinced that peaceful options to disarm Iraq had been exhausted and that military action was therefore justified.'I had made precisely the same observation to Ottawa at the time. In March 2003, there was no imminent threat from Saddam Hussein, a strategy of containment could have worked and UN inspections and monitoring could have continued. And if the U.S. and U.K. had endorsed rather than opposed a compromise along these lines, the Middle East would likely be a very different place than it is today.A fourth lesson is that, with the Chilcot report on Iraq, the Butler Review of Intelligence on Weapons of Mass Destruction and other reviews, the British have manifested an appetite for accountability that is probably unmatched elsewhere. We are still awaiting the U.S. inquiry into its hell-bent march to war in Iraq, which has been the worst U.S. foreign policy mistake since Vietnam, and, in terms of lasting negative, metastatic effects, probably its worst ever.A fifth lesson for Canada is that, especially on crucial foreign-policy decisions, it is never true that we have no choice but to support our allies. We always have a choice, if we are willing to pay the cost required by our values. And as it happened, those costs in the case of the Iraq war were entirely bearable.Canadian politicians and officials faced a tough situation and made the right judgments for the right reasons. Both Jean Chretien and Tony Blair described their decisions on the Iraq war as the most difficult they had to make in office. Mr. Blair made the wrong decision; Mr. Chretien made the right one. Rarely in public life has sound policy been so quickly and so totally vindicated., Where in the world is Rob Ford? And what is he doing? Good questions, and ones Torontonians deserve an answer to. Late last week, Mr. Ford went to Chicago, but he did not exactly arrive. As The Globe reported on Tuesday, he boarded a private jet bound for the American city, but when the plane reached its destination, the mayor 'voluntarily withdrew his application to enter the United States,' according to Roy Norton, Canada's consul general in Chicago. Mr. Norton says the mayor was 'not denied entry, per se.' But, for whatever reason, he was not at liberty to get off the plane.So where is Mr. Ford now? We don't know. His city hall colleagues don't know. The public doesn't know. In last week's statement abruptly announcing a leave of absence he stated that 'I have a problem with alcohol' - no mention of drugs - and 'I have decided to take a leave from campaigning and from my duties as mayor to seek immediate help.' He also said that this help would be 'professional help.' Various sources told several media outlets that he was going to rehab, but that was never officially confirmed. When asked about his whereabouts late last week, the mayor's lawyer, Dennis Morris, said that it was his 'understanding' that the mayor was at rehab in Chicago. The careful phrasing was perhaps necessary, since it turns out that the mayor never made it to the Windy City.So what is the mayor doing? Is he in some kind of a drug and alcohol abuse program? How long will he be there? The mayor's brother, Councillor Doug Ford, now says, 'He's in rehab, and that is all everyone cares about. No one in Toronto cares about where he is.' It's the usual Ford line: Trust us.Trust is not the first thing anyone should give Mayor Ford. He has demanded it almost as often as he has betrayed it. He has a record of taking liberties with the truth, or denying it outright, and only changing his tune once irrefutable contrary evidence is presented. That describes his repeated denials and eventual admissions of various alcohol-fuelled incidents and drug use; it also covers his promises to get help for his addictions.Last fall, after finally copping to excessive drinking and crack cocaine use - the latter explained by having been in a 'drunken stupor' - Mr. Ford said he had somehow gone cold turkey on the drinking. He 'guaranteed' that he had quit. He also claimed to be receiving unspecified medical help. But in his statement last week, the mayor seemed to be confessing to a fib, writing, 'I have tried to deal with these issues by myself over the past year. I know that I need professional help.' That would be the professional help he'd promised before.Given that the mayor's term in office has been defined by repeated violations of public trust, and by a record of evasiveness, lying and lying about the lying, the refusal to say much of anything on what the most senior public official in the country's largest city is up to is a bit hard to swallow. Just tell Torontonians the truth., The more you think about the Ontario government's secret $2.5-million payouts to three teachers' unions, the more questions come to mind. The reasoning for the payments, ostensibly made to help cover the unions' negotiating costs in the most recent round of bargaining, is full of holes.The government claims that a new bargaining system it put in place for teachers caused the talks to go on longer than normal, incurring unexpected costs for the Ontario Secondary School Teachers' Federation, the Ontario English Catholic Teachers' Association and the Association des enseignantes et des enseignants franco-ontariens. If that is the case, let's see an accounting, down to the penny. All those zeroes in a row suggest that no accounting was done; that these were lump payouts with an invented justification.But even if the justification weren't invented, that itself raises an important question: Why is the government covering the negotiating costs of organizations that exist to negotiate? Unions represent their members in collective bargaining, and they collect mandatory, tax-deductible union dues to do so.Furthermore, a provincial government constantly has to negotiate dozens of union contracts. It should be able to implement bargaining systems that allow it to manage the load. If this caused talks to go slowly for teachers' unions, tough luck. Where is the compensation for the government if a teachers' union walks away from the table or uses another method to protract negotiations? Where is the compensation for families who have to find child-care alternatives when teachers go on strike? If compensation for costs were a serious issue, it wouldn't be reserved for unions alone.So what was this money really for? You can buy the government's justification if you choose. But it's worth remembering that Ontario teachers' unions have, in fact, had some extraordinary political expenses of late.The OSSTF spent $385,000 during the 2014 provincial election as part of a union campaign against the Progressive Conservatives. The OECTA spent $2.1-million. Both unions backed Working Families, a Liberal-supporting union coalition that through several electoral cycles has run attack ads against the provincial Tories. This was not the first election where the unions spent big to back a side. It probably won't be the last., When the CBC recently unveiled its new five-year strategic plan, a document so comically Orwellian that the network should hire the consultants who wrote it to come up with a new sitcom, the elephant in the half-empty Toronto broadcasting centre went entirely unmentioned.The plan, titled A Space For Us All, refers to the Crown corporation as CBC/Radio-Canada, as if the English- and French-language networks constitute one entity with the same audience and digital challenges. In reality, all they share is a board of directors and mandate imposed on them by the federal Broadcasting Act.As the cuts keep coming, fans of Radio-Canada, one of the most watched public broadcasters anywhere, are starting to resent paying the price for the CBC's failure to connect with Canadians. That resentment is likely to grow as the broadcaster faces an ongoing cash crunch and slashes 1,500 more jobs by 2020.With the loss of Hockey Night in Canada, the only CBC program to consistently deliver big ratings, advertising revenues at the English network risk sinking below those brought in by the French side, which draws millions more viewers despite operating in a much smaller market.The last time the CBC lost hockey, during the 2012-13 NHL lockout, French and English ad sales were nearly equal. During the final quarter of 2012, the CBC's English services brought in $47.4-million, while revenues on the French side were $45-million. With hockey, the CBC's ad revenues are usually double.In April, however, CBC President Hubert Lacroix announced the merger of the French and English advertising departments, noting that 'with the loss of hockey, the importance of self-generated revenue is even more important and strategic.' In the Lacroix jargon, the merger is part of sharing 'our vision for a Canada-wide multi-platform offering with our business partners.'Radio-Canada supporters fear it's a money grab.With the federal subsidy still shrinking at the hands of a hostile Conservative government, will a successful French network be subsidizing a bloated English one that fails miserably in its mandate? If that's the case, CBC/Radio-Canada needs not one strategic plan, but two.Both the French and English networks need to deliver more content online and on smartphones, of course. But most of that content will continue to originate on the television side. Overall, Canadians watch almost 20 per cent more TV than they did a decade ago, so the medium is hardly dying.Here, the similarities end. Radio-Canada succeeds precisely because it can be all things to all people in a market that craves local content. Quebec elites complain that the French network has gone shamelessly down-market in recent years, but the truth is that it has always had a populist bent.It still broadcasts some of the most original and popular dramatic shows anywhere. (The top-rated Unite 9, a moody drama set in a federal women's prison, draws more than two million viewers.) The shows are mostly privately produced, but, like all Canadian-made shows, are heavily subsidized. Yet, they deliver significantly more bang for their buck than CBC dramas, which are set in Canada but stylistically American.Radio-Canada has no such serial envy. It also finds room in its grid for weekly shows on spirituality, agriculture/environment, science and nutrition. The Charbonneau commission might never have been created without the work done by Enquete, Radio-Canada's investigative reporting show.The network also makes abundant use of its archives with Tout le Monde en Parlait (Everyone Was Talking About It), which looks at big news events of the past. It was created on the heels of the success of Tout le Monde en Parle (Everyone Is Talking About It), the talk show that remains a Sunday-night ritual.Of course, Radio-Canada does a fine job promoting Quebecois culture, but pays only lip service to its official mandate, which is to 'contribute to a shared national consciousness and identity.' It is overly Quebec-centric, and should be taken to task for it.Still, Radio-Canada works. The CBC doesn't. It futilely chases ratings with American-style populist fare (wait until you see the fall lineup) while neglecting distinctive programming that English-Canadians can't get elsewhere.The CBC should probably be half the size, embrace the PBS model and emphasize public affairs. It can never be Radio-Canada. So why gut the French network trying?, An 11-year-old girl has been condemned to die. A second will likely follow suit. And then how many more?How does anyone dare to call this a victory?On Friday, Ontario Court Justice Gethin Edward rejected the pleas of McMaster Children's Hospital to compel child-welfare authorities to intervene and force J.J., a member of the Six Nations of the Grand River community who is suffering from leukemia, to resume chemotherapy. Without the treatment, the hospital argued, she has no chance of survival; with chemo, she has a good chance of being cured.The judge ruled that, because of her aboriginal status, J.J.'s mother D.H. has a constitutional right to refuse chemotherapy and 'pursue traditional medicine' on the child's behalf. (The family cannot be identified because of a publication ban.)This is being hailed as a precedent-setting decision for First Nations. It may be a legal victory of sorts, an affirmation and expansion of Section 35 of the Constitution Act of 1982, which guarantees aboriginal rights, but it's a hollow one if a child will suffer and die.What we should retain from this case - a case that never should have ended up in court - is that everyone failed to protect a child in need and, by extension, we have failed every child. (There is another eerily similar case unfolding, that of 11-year-old Makayla Sault of New Credit First Nation, but in the court of social media.)In August, when J.J. was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, she began treatment and underwent 10 days of the planned 32-day course of chemotherapy before her parents rejected the 'Western paradigm of medicine' and declared chemo to be poison.Indeed, chemotherapy is poison - poison that kills cancer cells. It's horrible for every child, aboriginal or otherwise. It looks like the hospital did not adequately assuage the parents' fears and could have been more culturally sensitive. When it sought to force the girl back into treatment by legal means, it set up an adversarial relationship.But say this for McMaster Children's: They put the child first, even though they knew pursuing the case would cause them untold grief. Hopefully, they will appeal the ruling.The child welfare agency, Brant Family and Children's Services, failed J.J. too. They decided she was not a 'child in need of protection' because she had loving parents, and tried to fob off the decision about forced treatment to others. But a child welfare agency has one job: to protect the welfare of children. Anything else is a dereliction of duty.The court failed J.J. too, and spectacularly.In similar cases, where parents have refused life-saving medical interventions for religious reasons (such as Jehovah's Witnesses refusing blood transfusions) or because they reject mainstream medicine for whatever reason, the courts have been quick to intervene and compel treatment.But in this case, the court decided that the parents' aboriginal rights take precedence over the life, liberty and security of an individual child. A judge's role is often to find the proper balance between conflicting rights; in this case, the scales of justice tipped the wrong way.Worse yet, the court afforded the parents the right to opt for 'traditional medicine' without defining that term. In fact, Judge Edward said the details of treatment (such as whether it actually works) are irrelevant; he essentially gave the parents carte blanche to do as they please. That's wrong because a child's life hangs in the balance. (And one of the more disturbing aspects of this case is that J.J.'s alternative 'treatment' has been at Florida's Hippocrates Health Institute, a 'holistic healing centre,' with a regime of massage and organic vegetables.)There is no question that horrible abuses and injustices have been rained upon First Nations and their children, in particular - consider the residential schools and the gross overrepresentation of aboriginal children in Canada's child welfare and foster care systems.But treating children like J.J. and Makayla for cancer - even though it evokes those horrific images of children being snatched from their parents once again - is not one of those abuses. On the contrary.If a non-aboriginal child had been in the same situation as J.J., she would almost certainly be getting treatment now. Every child needs to be protected from blatantly unreasonable acts by their parents, even well-intentioned ones.The affirmation of aboriginal rights should not condemn children to second-class treatment and death.A previous version of this story incorrectly stated Section 35 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. This has been changed to Section 35 of the Constitution Act of 1982., Shari Graydon is the Founder of Informed Opinions and author OMG - What if I Really AM the Best Person?, to be published next month.------------------------Was Justin Trudeau's promise to have women fill 50 per cent of his cabinet positions: (a) A crass play for progressive optics? (b) A lamentable abandonment of our long tradition of meritocracy? (c) Good public policy?Congratulations if you correctly guessed (c).In the days to come, many will analyze the merits of Mr. Trudeau's individual choices. But let's be clear about this: His decision to appoint equal numbers of male and female ministers is not only defensible, but also advisable.The federal cabinet makes decisions that profoundly affect all Canadians, more than half of whom happen to live lives irrevocably shaped by their extra X chromosome. Public policy - on health and labour, taxation, justice - needs to reflect and accommodate their realities.Consider Brian Mulroney's cabinet in 1989, featuring future prime minister Kim Campbell as one of only a handful of women in a cast of 40. During a discussion on access to abortion, a member of the anti-choice cohort proposed that women really ought to be educated about birth control. Ms. Campbell generously shared her considerable experience on the matter. She pointed out that many children are conceived by people who actually are practising responsible birth control. Then - too much information be damned - she described her own challenged contraceptive history. She cited a failed IUD (intrauterine device), the impracticality of the diaphragm and the reluctance of men to use condoms. Her discomfiting impromptu sex-ed class reminded many of her cabinet colleagues that they truly had no idea how to anticipate or address the needs of half the population they were elected to serve.As for meritocracy, let's not forget that female candidates continue to face greater challenges raising money, winning nominations and being perceived as leaders through a pervasive veil of unconscious bias. When they are elected, it's important to recall the famous words of Charlotte Whitton, two-time mayor of Ottawa, who noted, 'Whatever women do they must do twice as well as men to be thought half as good.'Selecting cabinet talent has always been balanced against the necessity of appointing ministers from different regions of the country. What is shocking, in retrospect, is that gender has, until recently, never been seen as a default category in need of consideration. How is it that previous PMs have catered to the interests of Atlantic, Prairie, Northern and Pacific Canadians, but not women?Now, in light of the substantive body of research documenting the benefits of diversity in decision-making, there's even less justification than ever before to not strive to improve all kinds of representation.This is not to say that the optics of a gender-balanced cabinet aren't significant. As the 2011 documentary Miss Representation points out, if you can't see her, you can't be her. High-profile, diverse women in varied careers and positions of authority allow their younger counterparts to imagine and pursue alternative futures for themselves.Vigdis Finnbogadottir spent 16 years as president of Iceland. The length of her service meant that a generation of Icelandic kids grew up knowing only a female head of state. After announcing her retirement in 1996, she was reportedly watching television with her young grandson as the candidates to succeed her were profiled on the news. In confusion, he turned to her and said, 'But Grandmother, they can't be president - they're men!' This speaks volumes about the power of role modelling: It has the capacity to make women's leadership not only conceivable, but also inevitable. (A number of observers credited the Commander in Chief TV series, about a female president, with increasing Americans' ability to imagine a woman in the White House, giving a bump to Hillary Clinton's run in 2008.)Similarly, research into what kinds of interventions make a difference to students who are statistically more likely to drop out of college finds that when women and members of other traditionally excluded groups receive messages such as 'You belong here,' their graduation rates increase.Canadians are justly proud of our democracy, but the fact that women's political representation is stalled at 26 per cent at the federal level remains an embarrassment. Today's gender-balanced cabinet is a great start, but let's not stop here., Canada's next chapter on going godless is gearing up for a nasty fight. It's a David versus Goliath match over a proposed law school. For now, 'David' is Trinity Western University, a Christian school funded solely by donations and unsubsidized tuition fees of its 4,000 students.TWU is the financial and spiritual love child of thousands of evangelical Christians in Canada. The Globe and Mail Educational Survey has consistently given TWU a grade of A+ for its quality. Students and alumni of TWU range from former Members of Parliament, a former coach for the Vancouver Canucks, and many corporate, and non-profit innovators around the world. TWU's published goal is to now 'found a law school focused on law as public service, encouraging students to satisfy unmet needs for legal services and promote social justice.'Enter Goliath: Law societies in Ontario, Nova Scotia, and the civil rights lawyer, Clayton Ruby are in court battles to shut the school down as discriminatory. The five-page belief and behavioral covenant at TWU aspires to have students limit sexual activity to the Biblical definition of marriage; 'between a man and a woman.' Mr. Ruby approached B.C.'s gay community and found a plaintiff, Mr. Trevor Loke. 'Mr. Loke had never heard of TWU, but when he heard there was a law school that was off limits to him in any meaningful way, that was an anathema, it was hateful,' Mr. Ruby told a Context TV debate.'Let's be clear here, we are not talking about acceptance of students, we are talking about while you are in law school here we are asking you to comply with this community covenant. We are not making it a term of acceptance that you not be gay, or deny that identity,' countered Earl Phillips of TWU.Not all lawyers agree that gay rights are being violated in this case. Not all Christians agree a true expression of Christianity is being extended in this case. But at the core of this fight, this is not an argument over what kind of sex students should or shouldn't be allowed to have.What we're really fighting over is the right to diversity. Lost in the fireworks of this case is that Canadian students choose TWU and its Covenant because it reflects their identity. Mr. Ruby's and the law societies' fight imply that such identity can't be trusted in their definitions of public life.'Within the confines of religion, the most inane nonsense can be believed and practiced and passed on to one's children. That's freedom of religion, have a nice time. But when you go to the government and say I want your approval for this, I want tax status for this, then it's beyond mere freedom of religion, there has to be a primacy for the right to equality,' Mr. Ruby said.Also a human rights lawyer, Mr. Phillips left taking Charter law cases as a partner with McCarthy Tetrault to become Executive Director of TWU's proposed law school. That is, if the school should ever be allowed to exist.'Am I allowed as a Christian to state my beliefs, to live by them and fully participate in society? Is the humanist allowed to state his opinions and beliefs, and fully participate in society? We will not necessarily come to agreement when we discuss these things. A truly pluralist diverse society understands there are differences, allows for room for those differences, allows room for peaceable and respectful discussion and allows for the fact that we may still end up in disagreement. And yet we live and work together peaceably in this country. That is what I think we mean by respect,' said Mr. Phillips.The most radical outcome of this case would be for the courts to decide that the two visions have to live side by side, with neither identity group able to force its morality on the other. Stretching and difficult, this is what it means to make space for authentic diversity in Canada. It's a case where Canadian civility and tolerance is on trial., Why did Hong Kong reject the United States' request to arrest Edward Snowden and hold him for extradition? And why does it now appear that Russia, too, will ignore U.S. pleas to expel and return the man who leaked information about the American government's systematic monitoring of cellphone calls and Internet usage? This breakdown in international cooperation is worrisome, and so too is Mr. Snowden's failure to acknowledge that the countries prepared to give him asylum are no friends of Internet freedom and free speech.The U.S. has an extradition treaty with Hong Kong, and numerous Americans have been sent home from the Chinese territory to face charges in their homeland. For reasons still unexplained, Hong Kong officials said a request from the U.S. to arrest and hold Mr. Snowden until his extradition was settled wasn't properly made, giving Mr. Snowden the opportunity to flee to Russia. We don't know what was wrong with an otherwise routine arrest request made, and granted, many times in the past, but we do know that Hong Kong officials linked Mr. Snowden's departure to reports that the U.S. government was spying on Hong Kong computers.In Russia, it appeared on Monday that Mr. Snowden, who is charged with theft of U.S. government property as well as two espionage-related charges, was able to arrive unhindered. His whereabouts were unknown in the hours after landing; officials there were saying nothing on Monday morning. Russia under Vladimir Putin has been a deliberate irritant of the West, whether in Syria or Iran, and it is a safe bet that it will not come to the aid of U.S. in this matter.As a result of Mr. Snowden's successful flight from U.S. justice, an important international convention has been compromised. The mutual aid provided between countries to return indicted criminals, whether by extradition treaty or not, is a critical part of every country's justice system. If criminals can simply flee across a border and be assured that extradition requests will be ignored without a proper hearing, it will become more difficult for every nation to prosecute its wanted suspects.As well, Mr. Snowden has become a pawn in the hands of governments that have little to no respect for Internet freedom and freedom of speech. China and Russia - countries where critics of the government face harassment, imprisonment and death - have already demonstrated that they are happy to use Mr. Snowden to embarrass the U.S. administration; no doubt Cuba, Ecuador or Venezuela will put him to the same use should he wind up in one of those countries.Wherever he finds asylum, Mr. Snowden should make sure he is not critical of his host government's policies. The United States was gathering data under a dubious pretense that deserved exposure, but it was doing so in an effort to thwart terrorist attacks, and its citizens have recourse to a robust justice system and constitutional protections. Mr. Snowdon's protectors have more nefarious reasons for looking into the lives of their citizens - citizens that have few, if any, protections., Women in management learn to listen for frequencies that are inaudible to male ears. When I was running a section of this newspaper, a management consultant once told me that I seemed irritable. Was irritability my leadership style?Yes, I should have told him, I was irritated by patronizing management consultants. My very competent (male) deputy was not asked about his level of tetchiness. I doubt any man would be.'Irritable.' 'Polarizing.' 'Brusque.' 'Bitchy.' Only one of those was aimed at me. The others were adjectives used to describe Jill Abramson, forced out of her job as executive editor of The New York Times this week. How about 'authoritarian' and 'Putin-like'? Those were the criticisms of Natalie Nougayrede, just ousted as the first female editor of the influential French newspaper Le Monde. That last criticism hurts; I'm not sure even Vladimir Putin wants to be described as 'Putin-like.'Two pioneering women, the first in their roles, gone in the same week. Two women deemed too bossy to be bosses. Can we extrapolate from their experiences? Probably not, because two is a tiny sample size. If there were more women executives in the media, we would know - but there aren't. (Technically, Ms. Nougayrede resigned after a revolt by the newsroom journalists who chose her, but there is no doubt she walked the plank with a cutlass at her back.)In the absence of much concrete information about Ms. Abramson's departure, rumours have been swirling - chief among them that she clashed with her boss, Arthur O. Sulzberger, and that she was annoyed (irritated, perhaps) to discover she wasn't making as much money as predecessor Bill Keller. The Times has denied these allegations, but Ken Auletta and The New Yorker have published figures that seem to back up the claim. Ms. Abramson hired a lawyer to look into the discrepancies, Mr. Auletta wrote, which stuck her bosses as 'especially combative.'Combative: There's another loaded word. It's fine if you're a soldier, I suppose, but not a quality you want in a female executive. Consider this observation, from a story on women's failure to negotiate better salaries for themselves: 'Discrimination persists in the workplace and it isn't necessarily intentional or overt, experts on gender and negotiation say. But it can emerge when women act in ways that aren't considered sufficiently feminine, and when women advocate for themselves.' That story appeared in The New York Times, less than two months before Ms. Abramson was fired. It's too bad she can't live on irony.Unfeminine: There's another good word to add to the box - perhaps later we can throw away the key. Women who aspire to leadership roles must be as wise and competent as their male colleagues, but on top of that, they must be genial and warm, because likeability is still the coin women are meant to spend. Managing a newsroom just makes it worse - journalists can be as ornery as cats woken in mid-nap, and they'll scratch if not petted the right way.Perhaps this exhausting juggling act explains why there are so few women executives in newspapers: Just 10 per cent of the highest posts in Canada are held by women, according to a 2006 survey, and 23 per cent in the United States (the U.S. figure covers TV and radio, too).Forty years after a group of heroic female employees launched a discrimination suit against The New York Times, women in newspapers still make, on average, just 83 per cent of men's wages. Back then, star Times financial reporter Eileen Shanahan discovered she was making substantially less than male reporters who were half as good. She asked for a raise, but was told she was making the union rate, 'and that's enough for her.' That's enough for her: Hard to believe the ink hasn't faded on that message after four decades.We think sexism is dead in the newsroom and elsewhere, but just because it's harder to see doesn't mean it's not there. This is one of the themes of Vivian Smith's forthcoming book, Outsiders Still: Why Women Journalists Love - and Leave - Their Newspaper Careers. 'Look at Jill Abramson,' says Ms. Smith, a former Globe and Mail reporter. 'Let's say she was very direct. So what? Isn't that a quality you want in an editor-in-chief?'One top editor at a Canadian paper told her, 'That's haunted me forever, that we can't be leaders and women.' Young reporters and editors told Ms. Smith that they didn't see a way to climb through the ranks that made sense, because there were so few women to show the way.Now there are two fewer. Ms. Abramson is gone after less than three years, and Ms. Nougayrede after just a year. Two women who did not plunder the treasure chest, steer their ships onto the rocks or grow senile at the wheel. Instead, their crimes seem to exist in charting their own paths by their own rules. And that route, apparently, is too dangerous. Feel free to be irritated., When it comes to trying to end long-standing conflicts, Barack Obama was off to a good start this week. He had snuffed out the last embers of the Vietnam War by ending a 50-year-old military embargo. He removed the last vestiges of dehumanizing racism from U.S. policy by signing a bill that banishes the word 'negro' from the criminal code. And, on top of that, he killed the leader of the Taliban.Well, someone else, piloting a drone from a military base inside the United States, killed Akhtar Mansour, by firing a laser-guided missile into the Taliban chief's vehicle as it cruised down a northern Pakistan road.But it was the President's kill. First, because he personally authorized it. By ending the life of an extremist leader who refused to enter into peace talks, he announced, he hoped that the Taliban, after pulling itself together, would come to the table.Second, because leadership decapitations, as these strikes are known, are Mr. Obama's signature policy. The tightly geared killing of Osama bin Laden was the definitive move by a President who has generally backed away from the full-scale occupations that turned the previous decade into such a catastrophe.That's the Obama approach: Skip the war and kill the chief bad guy, in hopes that his whole organization will collapse around him. It's an appealing strategy.Who didn't cheer Mr. bin Laden's demise? A leadership decapitation doesn't sound so bad when its victims are men who are responsible for scores of actual, literal decapitations.But does it work?One reason why Mr. Obama's Taliban-termination received hardly more attention than his other acts on Monday is because people increasingly feel like it doesn't. The Taliban appointed another leader, its third. Al-Qaeda has sprung back to life. Some have likened decapitation policies to Whac-a-Mole games: Bash a bad guy, and another one springs up.Boss-offing is not a mysterious topic: In recent years, an entire science of decapitation analysis has sprung up.The most influential number-crunching was conducted in 2009 by Jenna Jordan, a researcher at the University of Chicago (she is now at Georgia Tech). She analyzed 298 incidents of 'leadership targeting' over six decades and looked at their impact on the organizations whose leaders were the recipients of these abrupt terminations.Her results were far from encouraging. Her data showed that decapitation, on average, 'does not increase the likelihood of organizational collapse beyond a baseline rate of collapse for groups over time.'In fact, the extremist groups most likely to fall apart (that is, to stop being able to commit attacks and wage war) are actually those whose leaders have not been killed: Hitting the head honcho actually seems to help groups keep fighting longer - perhaps because it rather literally injects some fresh blood into the organization.More recent analyses have questioned these findings. Certain groups have indeed self-imploded following the untimely demise of their figurehead: Peru's Shining Path faded into irrelevance after its leader Abimael Guzman was captured; Italy's Red Brigades did not outlast its founding leaders; the capture of Abdullah Ocalan disempowered Turkey's Kurdistan Workers' Party for a decade.In a big-data study last year, Bryan Price of the U.S. Military Academy analyzed 207 terrorist groups from 1970 to 2008, but instead of looking at their effectiveness, he examined their longevity.He found that taking out the executives 'significantly increases the mortality rate of terrorist groups, even after controlling for other factors' - but it often takes longer than we'd like. Counterterrorism, he concluded, is a long game. He also found that the groups most likely to implode after things blow up in the head office are nationalists. Groups that see themselves as religious, he found, are more tolerant of bloodbaths at the top. Of 53 religious groups, only 19 have ended - 16 of them after their boss was wiped out. But of the 34 such terrorist groups still in existence (including al-Qaeda and the Islamic State), 20 have endured a decapitation strike.There are other good reasons to knock off the kingpins: Inspiring morale in your troops, hurting jihadi recruitment by looking all-powerful, sowing moments of chaos that can be exploited. But there's no reason to think they'll make the fight any easier, or the world less bloody., In 1985, Margaret Atwood released The Handmaid's Tale, a dystopian novel set in a future where women's reproductive freedom was brutally controlled by a group of allegedly god-fearing men. It was made into a movie, an opera and now, 30 years later, it's become real life.I wish this were hyperbole. I would much prefer that the reproductive rights of women in the United States were not under constant and relentless bombardment by a group of men (and one woman) who would like to become that country's chief executive. It would be nice if even one of them recognized that this is the 21st century and that women in the United States have had a legal right to choose abortion for more than 40 years.Let's just look at a tiny sample of the nuanced positions adopted by the 2016 Republican nominee candidates, which appeared to have been scripted on the wall of a cave.Senator Marco Rubio: 'I think future generations will look back at this history of our country and call us barbarians for murdering millions of babies who we never gave them a chance to live.' Ben Carson: 'I am totally opposed to killing babies.'Or how about Donald Trump calling Planned Parenthood an 'abortion factory,' before doing an about-face and offering meagre support for that organization, a slimy move even for a man who has a PhD in slime?The Republican candidates have used the recent Planned Parenthood controversy to establish their bona fides as the least woman-friendly fellow on the ticket. In each case, though, the candidates - from Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal to former Texas governor Rick Perry to Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker - have for years been fighting to erode women's reproductive freedom.All three instituted brutal legislation at the state level to restrict access to abortion (though courts have struck down some of those restrictions).These men, who idealize the notion of a tiny and hands-off government, have no problem insisting that the government's hands perform an internal exam on a woman before she can have an abortion - a procedure, to be clear, which is her right.The Planned Parenthood commotion is a red herring, although a convenient one for the Republicans. To recap: Over the past month, the anti-choice Center for Medical Progress has released six videos, shot surreptitiously with Planned Parenthood doctors and other officials, in which the sale of fetal tissue is discussed. There are more videos yet to be released.Selling fetal tissue for profit is illegal under U.S. law. What is allowed is charging a certain amount to cover the costs of, say, research and shipping the tissue (which is inarguably valuable to scientists, and has been crucial in the development of vaccines and treatment of disease).Planned Parenthood has vehemently denied any wrongdoing and calls the allegations 'outrageous and completely false.'Its supporters point to the fact the organization helps millions of women (and men) every year, providing affordable contraception, cancer screening and other services to clients who might not be able to pay for care elsewhere.But complexity of argument is about as useless as an ice cream umbrella in a year when every candidate is trying to claim the most self-righteous ground.So Carly Fiorina, the lone female Republican contestant, speaks of the 'moral depravity' of Planned Parenthood, and Senator Ted Cruz calls the organization 'callous and heartless.' Jeb Bush wonders if $500-million (U.S.), the group's federal funding, isn't too much to spend on 'women's health care.' As we all know, health care is much more cheaply provided at night in dark alleys.The Republicans have already tried unsuccessfully to cut off Planned Parenthood's federal funding. They'll try again. At least four men running for president successfully defunded the group when they were state governors.The scandal isn't about fetal tissue (abortions provide about 3 per cent of Planned Parenthood's services and aren't publicly funded). It's that women's freedom is under threat across the United States: The National Women's Law Center has outlined the historic repression of abortion rights, with 135 new restrictions passed in 2011 and 2012 alone. Many women are now required to travel great distances or endure humiliating examinations before they can gain access to the care that is their right.This repellent sideshow will, with luck, turn off a great portion of American voters. It's been called a 'war on women,' but it's not, really. It's a war on anyone who cares about freedom., What a pity that Justin Trudeau's victory speech had to come after Jean Chretien and Bob Rae addressed the Liberals gathered in Ottawa to celebrate the end of the leadership race. The contrast was terrible.The former prime minister embodied political experience and wisdom, and the crowd roared with laughter at his jokes. Mr. Rae, the departing interim leader of the party, exuded maturity and self-confidence. Who knows if the party would be in the same sorry state if the delegates had had the good sense to elect him leader in 2006?Then this charming young man came on stage, looking like a student in a model Parliament, trying to fit into a suit much too large for him. He delivered in a rather flat tone a speech filled with goodwill and platitudes. It didn't help that Mr. Trudeau, at the relatively ripe age of 41, looks so much younger.As he spoke, one couldn't help thinking about how his father would have sounded on the same podium. And of course the difference was crushing. The allure. The style. The eloquence. The culture. The steely mind. The intellectual authority that even his adversaries admired.Yes, I know, comparisons are unfair - especially in this case, since Justin Trudeau is more his mother's son than his father's. He inherited Margaret Sinclair's sentimentality and gracious smile, her generosity and her natural ability to connect with people. He is everything his father wasn't, at least as a public persona. The problem is that, so far, there's no sign that he has what his father had - leadership and vision.Still, this doesn't prevent his more frenetic supporters from heralding the birth of a dynasty. A few months ago, the Toronto Star excitedly pointed out that Justin's son, Xavier, was born on an 'auspicious date,' the 88th anniversary of Pierre Elliott Trudeau's birth. Xavier for prime minister in 2050?What's certain is that Justin Trudeau is blessed with incredibly good luck. Try holding two little kids in your arms, including a rambunctious five-year-old boy, without losing your balance and looking gauche. He did, and the resulting photo was fabulous. Even his wife, who had just rushed to the stage to bring him the children, was perfectly composed and prettier than ever.In his speech, Mr. Trudeau made a special appeal to Quebeckers, urging them to join their fellow Canadians to build a better country. It's the kind of pitch that Stephen Harper, among others, used to no avail. The new Liberal Leader wisely abstained from flirting with the soft nationalist vote by wading into murky constitutional terrain - his priority is to bring back into the Liberal fold the non-separatist voters lost to the NDP.Now that he's finished riding on his family name, he wants to be known by his first name, for what he is. Especially in Quebec as in the West, where Pierre Trudeau left sour memories, he makes a point of distancing himself (with all due respect) from his father on some issues. Will this work?All we know is that for now, Justin Trudeau raises no hostility in Quebec, just polite indifference. My guess, though, is that many Quebeckers may come to like him, for the simple reason that this young, non-confrontational and hard-working family man is, indeed, likeable. In an era when people are fed up with traditional politicians, Justin Trudeau's main asset is that he is the very opposite of a traditional politician., Pollster Darrell Bricker and Globe columnist John Ibbitson argue in their book The Big Shift that Canada has moved west politically, economically and demographically, and left what they call 'the Laurentian elite' behind. There's no question that the country's demography is changing. But I think they're mistaken on some key points.Mr. Bricker and Mr. Ibbitson argue that the Ottawa Press Gallery, like the Laurentian elite, 'is obsessed with the influence and importance of Quebec.' On the contrary, I think the English-speaking press gallery, like the elite, is largely oblivious to Quebec.Only a few English-speaking reporters and columnists - or private-sector leaders - are comfortable in French, or knowledgeable about Quebec. Almost everyone else looks at Quebec as a mystery they wish would go away. I would argue that a much more prevalent attitude in a large part of the political class is: 'At least we don't have to feel guilty about not being bilingual because Quebec doesn't matter for this government.'Mr. Bricker and Mr. Ibbitson argue, quite correctly, that the West is in, with a Prime Minister, Clerk of the Privy Council, Chief Justice of the Supreme Court and Governor of the Bank of Canada all from Western Canada. They could have added the former chief of the defence staff, not to mention the ministers of Citizenship and Immigration and Canadian Heritage. But they neglected to mention that they're all fluently bilingual. They learned French because they were ambitious, and they wanted to understand the whole country.The same thing applies to provincial premiers. In fact, we're now in the unique situation that a majority of Canada's premiers are bilingual. Why? They're bright and want to understand the country as a whole. A former French ambassador once told me that one of the things that impressed him most about Canada is that French is the language of ambition.At one point, the book describes Mr. Bricker's attendance at a parade of a very diverse army cadet corps, where a remarkable proportion of the cadets were non-Caucasian. I could give the same description of French and immersion classrooms across the country. Visible minority community members are actually more bilingual in English and French than English Canadians who've been in Canada for generations.What immigrant students in immersion have told me is that learning French made them feel more Canadian. And French-language schools across the country are full of students - and staff - from the Maghreb, French-speaking Africa and Haiti. These students and teachers are a vibrant part of French-speaking communities across the country.Mr. Bricker and Mr. Ibbitson say Quebec will be 'protecting a language that fewer Canadians or global citizens will understand.' To begin with, there are now more Canadians who speak French than ever before. And there are four million French-speaking Canadians who don't speak English. Anecdotally, in observing the children of my friends and the friends of my children, I can name young Canadians who have studied in China and learned Chinese, taught English in Japan and learned Japanese, worked on water projects in Vietnam and learned Vietnamese, spent time in Central America and learned Spanish, and visited Berlin and learned German. But they all learned the other Canadian language first.What I sensed in the book, although it was never explicitly expressed, was a kind of relief. The message, in effect, is: 'Get with the program, we don't have to feel guilty that we never learned French, and we don't have to kiss Quebec any more. Bye-bye linguistic duality, hello cultural diversity.'Well, we have nine million people in this country who speak French, four million of whom speak no English. Our French-speaking society is increasingly diverse in its reality and global in its attitude.Consider some of the French-language films produced in the past few years: L'Ange de goudron (2001), about an Algerian immigrant family in Montreal; A Sunday in Kagali (2006), based on Gil Courtemanche's novel about the Rwandan genocide; Incendies (2010), based on a Wajdi Mouawad play about the horrors of a Middle Eastern civil war; Monsieur Lazhar (2011), about an Algerian refugee in Montreal; Rebelle (2012), about a Congolese child soldier; and Inch'Allah (2012), about a Canadian doctor in the Middle East. Three of these films were Canadian nominees for an Academy Award.Consider the number of French-speaking Canadian singers who are touring Europe (Les Cowboys Fringants, Lynda Lemay) and Quebec actors who are performing in French films (Marc-Andre Grondin, Marie-Josee Croze). And consider the television industry, the publishing industry and the recording industry.All of this isn't the product of a society of old white pensioners, or what Mr. Bricker and Mr. Ibbitson call 'Canada's version of Greece.' It's the product of a dynamic, culturally vibrant, multicultural, French-speaking society whose major city and cultural hub is as energetic and creative in its own way, in both official languages (think Rawi Hage and Arcade Fire) as Toronto and Vancouver.This isn't a cultural dynamism that has anything to do with a Laurentian elite. English-speaking Canada can feel a sense of pride and ownership in this success - or it can write it off, turn away and ignore it.I share Mr. Bricker and Mr. Ibbitson's enthusiasm for the changing demography in Canada, and the energy it represents. But those changes are occurring in French just as much as they are in English.Graham Fraser is Canada's Official Languages Commissioner., Something quite predictable happened when Quebec's Liberal government recently suggested increasing the number of immigrants the province accepts each year to 60,000 from the current 50,000. The blowback was immediate, the critics apoplectic, and the government's retreat expeditious.Quebec's population is aging faster than anywhere in Canada outside the Atlantic provinces. Its work force is shrinking, creating labour shortages in some sectors. The novelty of policies aimed at getting Quebeckers to have more babies - cheap daycare and generous parental leave - has worn off. Quebec's birth rate fell for the sixth year in a row in 2015. At 1.6 births per woman of child-bearing age, it's down from a 2009 peak of 1.73, and now matches the national average.A recent government white paper warned that maintaining immigration at the current 50,000 annual level would lead to a 'marked' decline in the working-age population between 2016 and 2031, putting a damper on economic growth and everything that flows from it. Starting at 60,000 immigrants a year, however, the work force would continue to grow well into the future.A healthy discussion of immigration thresholds would consider these factors while reviewing the longer-term evidence. Since the adoption of the province's Bill 101 in 1977, requiring the children of immigrants to attend French-language schools, several cohorts of new Quebeckers have embraced la langue de Moliere and successfully integrated into francophone society. The proportion of Quebeckers speaking French at home remained a robust 82.5 per cent in 2011, while almost 95 per cent of all Quebeckers could speak French, according to Statistics Canada.Yet, despite such reassuring evidence, opposition politicians showed the usual reflexes in denouncing the government for merely raising the possibility of an increase in immigration. Granted, immigration is a touchier subject in Quebec than anywhere else in Canada, given francophone Quebeckers's perception of themselves as a threatened minority within North America. As the debate about the former Parti Quebecois government's Charter of Values demonstrated in 2013, the perceived threat is not merely linguistic, but cultural and religious, as well.Still, the opposition PQ and Coalition Avenir du Quebec didn't focus on those aspects as much as the short-term economic costs of accepting more immigrants. Curiously, this is the same argument raised by prominent Quebec economist Pierre Fortin, who also warns against an increase in immigration quotas.But while it's true that immigrants to Quebec have initially tended to face more difficulty integrating into the work force - employer discrimination and lack of English-language skills being among the main reasons - they also tend to catch up by the five- or 10-year mark. And Quebec's new policy of choosing immigrants in line with qualifications and labour market requirements will only hasten the integration of newcomers.Besides, immigration is the opposite of a short-term policy. It is a long-term investment in a society's future dynamism and prosperity. A community that invests in its immigrants will see its immigrants, and their descendants, invest in it. If Canada is an example of anything, it is this.Slow or zero population growth is a recipe for decline - economic, social, cultural. Choosing this path out of the fear that more immigration might not only change the face, but the fibre, of Quebec society would be to condemn the province to increasing marginalization within Canada and the world.As much as Quebec sometimes feels closer to Europe than to the rest of Canada, Europe would be the wrong model for Quebec on immigration policy. A quarter of all immigrants who arrived in Quebec in the decade up to 2013 subsequently left the province, some because they sensed an unwelcoming environment. Quebec needs to devote more resources not only to attracting immigrants, but to retaining them after they arrive.So what if it means some will need to learn English (in addition to French) to successfully integrate into the workplace? That is a reality faced by most Quebeckers, whether native-born or not. Most professions these days, especially if they involve technology, require some functionality in English.No francophone Quebecker I know considers unilingualism an asset, yet the suggestion that immigrants should learn both of Canada's official languages sparks howls of protest from the PQ and CAQ, which seek to make political hay out of Quebeckers' insecurities. It's an insult to the resourcefulness of Quebeckers who, over four centuries, have maintained their linguistic identity in the face of far bigger cultural threats than the presence of bilingual immigrants.If anything, Quebec needs more of them., How did everyone cope with the great sugar panic of '14? Did you hurl your chocolate bars overboard, hoping to borrow a few more years from the Grim Reaper? Or did you reach for a May West or a Twinkie, thinking, 'In for a penny, in for a pound cake'?I responded to the new World Health Organization guidelines on sugar intake (optimally, only 5 per cent of your daily calories) by pointing a finger at my vanilla latte and whispering 'J'accuse.' Breakfast, it turns out, is one of the more lethal times of day, which is not something they teach you in university. When I think about the risks I've taken in life (and there have been a few), I never expected to find 'blueberry muffin' at the top of the list.Sugar is the new Public Enemy No. 1, Al Capone in a porcelain bowl. The WHO's draft guidelines note, quite reasonably, that excess sugar consumption can mean 'an unhealthy diet, weight gain and increased risk of noncommunicable diseases.' But how little per day? Less than is contained in a can of pop. Never mind all the other sugar you consume in ready meals, condiments and cookies.Last month, a U.S. study found that those who took a quarter or more of their daily calories in sugar tripled their risk of heart disease. An advocacy group called Action on Sugar has declared that 'sugar is the new tobacco.'I like to think of this particular argument as reductio ad tobaccum, considering how many foodstuffs have recently been declared as dangerous as a pack of Player's. A couple of years ago, a Canadian study claimed that consuming egg yolks was as lethal as smoking, and then their natural platemate, bacon, got the same designation. Now, it's protein. A new, widely circulated study from the journal Cell Metabolism claims that middle-aged people who ate a diet high in meat and dairy substantially increased their risk of developing cancer. 'We provide convincing evidence that a high-protein diet - particularly if the proteins are derived from animals - is nearly as bad as smoking for your health,' one of the researchers, biologist Valter Longo, was quoted as saying.You may wonder, as you scrape the cream cheese from your plate and replace it with a nice mound of parsley, if everything is as dangerous as smoking, why not just give in? What on earth are you supposed to put in your body? The information is deafening, a cacophony, and often contradictory. The best advice probably comes from Michael Pollan, author of many useful books on the politics of grub, who wrote: 'Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants.'But that bit of quiet, sage wisdom doesn't really stand a chance when pitted against headlines like Could Your Sausage Kill You?! (Yes, Daily Mail, it could, if it were made out of steel, sharpened, and stuck in your eye.) If people are confused about nutrition, it's no wonder, considering that every few years a new lethal, payload comes barrelling down the highway: Cholesterol, trans fats, acrylamides. Is salt still bad for you? (Apparently not, according to a recent article in The Globe by Dr. John Sloan.) How about saturated fats? (Rehabilitated, I think.) In the great margarine-butter cage match, butter has wrestled its oily opponent to the ground and stands triumphant. That could all be flipped over tomorrow.The danger is that the average person throws up her hands in despair. Let's assume we're all generally rational guardians of our families' health: Our kids are vaccinated, we get the flu shot every year and only occasionally do we succumb to the siren song of the cigarette or the Hickory Stick. We drink in moderation (for Torontonians, a useful benchmark is 'less than the mayor'). So how do we assess the various risks to our individual health when we're looking at a menu and trying to remember which will kill us sooner, the feta or the onion rings?Here, it's useful to turn to David Spiegelhalter, the Winton Professor of the Public Understanding of Risk, at Cambridge University, who not only has the best job title in the world but also some excellent insights into this kind of decision-making. First, you divide your risk potential into acute (rock falling toward your head) and chronic (repeated abuse of BLT). As Prof. Spiegelhalter said in a TEDx lecture, 'A Spam fritter, unless you choke on it, is not going to kill you on the spot, but if you keep on stuffing them down your gob year after year, it's not going to do you any good at all.'Similarly, public-health warnings carrying dire advice about shortened lifespans often fall on shuttered ears because people think they'd rather have pleasure now than an extra year at the end when they're 'old and dribbly.' A better way to think of health risks, he says, is to imagine your life sped up, or consumed, by poor choices - to consider that a hamburger or two cigarettes can eat a half-hour of your life. (Although, Prof. Spiegelhalter points out, so does an episode of Friends. Pick your poison.)Would I trade a half-hour for a May West? Probably not, but I would for a steak. Or are steaks good for us again? Somebody let me know when the jury's in.Follow me on Twitter: @lizrenzetti, Just when you thought the Harper Conservatives could stoop no lower with their attack ads against Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau, they discovered something even more base.Household mailings, paid for by taxpayers, are supposed to communicate information from MPs to constituents about doings in government. Every MP, of course, puts her or his spin on things because, after all, they're politicians. But household mailings often contain straightforward information about which government office a constituent should phone, how to apply for government programs, or what this or that piece of legislation means.But now the Conservatives have decided to use these mailings - as much as 10 per cent of the voters receive them at any one time - as nothing more than a printed negative ad against Mr. Trudeau. It's one thing for the Conservative Party to use its money to buy television airtime to demean Mr. Trudeau; it's another to use your money for the same base purposes. But as we see, the Harper attack machine does politics this way, always has and always will, because the Prime Minister - who authorizes all this stuff, after all - obviously thinks it works.And until now, it has. But will it against Mr. Trudeau? It's too soon to tell, but what could happen is that the ads, while creating negative perceptions of Mr. Trudeau, might also reinforce them against the perpetrator, Stephen Harper. At some point, this sort of gutter messaging might strike Canadians as more revealing of the sender than the target, although it should be said that gutter messaging has demonstrably worked before - which is why the Conservative attack machine uses it.Canadians in the main already have a negative perception of the Prime Minister. In April, EKOS Research asked 4,568 Canadians (using interactive voice response technology), 'Do you approve or disapprove of how Stephen Harper is handling his job?' By 50 per cent to 28 per cent, the response was No. That 28-per-cent score was the lowest approval rating the Prime Minister has had. It compares, for example, with 40 per cent in 2010.The Prime Minister's approval rating was negative in every province, except Alberta - but even there the favourable responses exceeded the negative ones by only a small margin.EKOS also asked about the direction of the country and found that, by 49 per cent to 39 per cent, people thought Canada was heading in the 'wrong direction.' Asked whether the government was heading in the 'wrong direction,' 54 per cent of respondents (against 34 per cent) said Yes.Then, this week, along comes the Harris-Decima poll showing much more favourable responses for Mr. Trudeau than for Mr. Harper. Various polls now show the Liberals slightly ahead on party preference. In Quebec, the latest CROP poll shows the federal Liberals catapulting into first place under Mr. Trudeau, with the provincial Liberals also taking top spot under their new leader, Philippe Couillard.Mr. Harper scores best on polls for leadership and experience - which is what you'd axiomatically expect for any prime minister in office for more than six years. On any criterion of likeability, listening or being in touch with Canadian values, his stock plummets.Polls are only snapshots. They can change, and likely will. Certainly, the curiosity factor as the new boy on the scene plays in Mr. Trudeau's favour, just as it did, we should remember, for Michael Ignatieff when he became Liberal leader. As a new leader in the limelight, impressions of Mr. Trudeau are likely to jump around until more settled initial opinions take hold - which is precisely why the Harper Conservatives immediately launched those attack ads and household mailings.It's comforting for those who don't like Mr. Harper to see polls confirming that he isn't very popular. But remember that the Conservative base is rock-solid. Party members think very highly of him, they're more likely to vote than supporters for the other parties, and they're very, very motivated. And keeping the core motivated is the Conservatives' abiding preoccupation., Drawing parallels between Canada and the United States on criminal justice matters can be tendentious. Laws and practices differ, and so do circumstances.But at least one aspect of the events in Ferguson, Mo., is relatable to the Canadian experience: Death often seems to be treated differently when that death is caused by a cop. Contemporary examples of the phenomenon are plentiful, and not just in the U.S.There's been a litany of police-involved fatalities in Canada since the Braidwood inquiry probed Robert Dziekanski's entirely unnecessary death at the hands of the RCMP in 2007; the most recent to provoke an outcry cost the life of a five-year-old child in suburban Montreal.Nicholas Thorne-Belance died last winter after the car his dad was driving was struck by an unmarked police car, travelling at 122 kilometres per hour in a 50 km/h zone. It wasn't an emergency, and the officer behind the wheel wasn't charged. Prosecutors defended their decision last week and even laid part of the blame for the crash on the child's father, citing a witness account. But that witness has since come forward to contradict the Crown's characterization. The provincial government has set up an independent investigation.No, police officers don't always walk when someone dies in the course of their duties. Toronto officer James Forcillo faces murder charges for shooting Sammy Yatim on a streetcar in July, 2013, a case where prosecutors have the advantage of multiple witness videos. But more needs to be done to forestall a toxic perception from taking root - that once you don a police uniform different standards apply. Police officers, precisely because they are given unique powers and weapons, should if anything be held to an even higher standard.There have been many calls for reform, and jurisdictions across Canada are grappling with various aspects of policing such as use of force, de-escalation and appropriate oversight. Part of the difficulty is institutional, with police often investigating other police, and police and prosecutors working cheek-by-jowl. But even in Ontario, which has a separate Special Investigations Unit to probe police use-of-force incidents, there often appears to be little enthusiasm for zealously prosecuting questionable police-involved deaths.The events of Ferguson, Mo., serve as an object example of why the question - who is policing the police? - must be taken more seriously. In Canada, Quebec's new inquiry is just a start., The epidemic - and there is no other word for it - of fatal drug overdoses in British Columbia beggars belief: 755 so far this year, 128 in November alone, 13 in a single day in December.There were more deaths from fentanyl last month in B.C. than there were murders in the province last year.If a virus were the cause of these deaths, a massive public-health response would be under way. But the health crisis in this case is one of addiction, a contentious and misunderstood disease that is viewed with suspicion instead of empathy.And so officials in Vancouver, where the majority of the overdoses are occurring, and the B.C. government are scrambling to deal with this mind-boggling onslaught largely on their own.The province has been flooded with toxic synthetic opioids that are deadly in low doses. Imported from China, illicit fentanyl and carfentanil have been killing addicts and recreational drug users who are unprepared for the potency of these new drugs.Vancouver's city council has responded by raising property taxes to fund a new community policing centre, more front-line staff and a new medic unit in the Downtown Eastside, where many of the overdoses occur.The province has declared a public-health emergency and promised more hospital beds to treat people with addictions. It has also opened new safe-injection sites where addicts can get their fix with other people around, in case they overdose.But health officials have had to acknowledge that, at this point, they are losing the battle.The federal government needs to bring its considerable resources to play. Ottawa has taken steps, but they have been legislative ones aimed at stopping the import of the drugs, and the equipment used to prepare them for sale, as well as removing legal roadblocks to supervised injection sites.What is needed now is an acknowledgment by the federal government that this is not British Columbia's problem alone. This is an epidemic that will likely spread, and it needs to be contained and rolled back in the same fashion as an outbreak of a deadly disease would be.Ottawa should go at it the same way it would deal with an epidemic spread of a deadly flu. The first step involves Health Canada reinforcing the message that drug addiction is a disease, not a crime, which would help overcome the inertia that has stalled the response to this crisis.Prime Minister Justin Trudeau could drive that point home, and bring a lot of attention to the human side of the story, by visiting one of the new supervised injection sites. The federal and provincial governments should also be pitching in more financially: Health emergencies crossing boundaries are not a challenge that should be left to municipal taxpayers, or municipal governments. It's bigger than them.And then once the situation in B.C. is brought under control, Ottawa has to launch something that has long been needed in Canada: an aggressive program to help people wean themselves off the opioids that are at the root of the crisis.This is a catastrophe that was in part created innocently, and by accident, in doctor's offices. Many physicians have been over-prescribing opioids for years, inadvertently dooming patients to addiction.Ontario, like other provinces, has begun to crack down on MDs who liberally prescribe the drugs, a response that came after more than 700 people died from opioid overdoses in the province in 2015.It's the right move, but there's a catch.Patients who cannot wean themselves off the drug once their prescription ends - again, it's an addiction - may well turn to the street for a replacement. That could put them in contact with illicit fentanyl in the form of counterfeit pills masquerading as the less-powerful prescription brand they are familiar with - as has happened to some users in B.C. who overdosed.The best way to protect people from overdosing on illicit opioids is to help them get off their addictions. This will require more treatment centres and more trained personnel. Ottawa could consider leaning on the manufacturers of opioids to help cover the costs, but whatever it does, it should not do it in half-measures.The B.C. crisis is partly about what happens when societies fail to recognize that addiction is a health issue, and instead leave it mostly up to police and courts to deal with the problem. Fentanyl addiction is literally knocking on the door of every province. A number of northern U.S. states are having their own opioid crises, and the drug is primed to flow north.Canada can either treat this as a national issue, and stand a chance of success, or it can deal with the problem in a piecemeal fashion - one local epidemic at a time., Signa Daum Shanks is a professor at Osgoode Hall Law School. Adam Dodek is a professor at the University of Ottawa's Faculty of Law and a co-founder of its Public Law Group.We are Blue Jays fans, and while we'll be cheering for Toronto to defeat Cleveland in the American League Championship Series, we shudder when we imagine the phrase 'Blue Jays pummel Indians'. There is no longer any place for indigenous mascots to represent sports teams. Not in the United States, and certainly not in Canada.Using team names like 'Indians', 'Chiefs', 'Braves', 'Redskins' or 'Eskimos' is offensive: They are race-based and they should be abandoned if not prohibited. Would we really be having such a conversation if a high school football team were called the 'Northern Negroes' or if a professional sports franchise in Canada had the name 'Jasper Jewboys'? Not likely.Using indigenous peoples as team names is the worst form of cultural appropriation. It takes an entire people and reduces them to the basest of stereotypes. If you have any doubt, simply look at Cleveland's logo, Chief Wahoo. This is no tribute to indigenous peoples: it is a cartoonish amalgamation of stereotypes that demean the dignity of real people.In a baseball game, the umpire calls out strikes loudly for all to hear. So too should fans of the game call out racism.Indigenous team names threaten our personal security. Yelling, 'kill the Indians!' on the street may be a precursor to a hate crime, but inside the Rogers Centre it is not only acceptable, but encouraged by some. Imagine how an indigenous person would experience being surrounded by people yelling various things, including phrases about 'those goddamn Indians' or worse.Now change that phrase to mention whatever group you belong to and say the same phrase, or change it to say your group is 'stupid' or 'cheating'.Why are indigenous persons expected to accept such indignities? Why do the rest of us not challenge the sports teams and the leagues for promoting such attitudes and egging racism on.The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms protects security of the person. The Supreme Court of Canada has said this includes both physical and psychological security. And various human rights codes are supposed to ensure that discrimination is not part of public spaces, like ballparks. This country's trends in laws and political policies apply to all who are located here, including teams that originate from other countries.The City of Cleveland cannot be faulted for not knowing about Canada's Truth and Reconciliation Commission. And Blue Jays fans who are at their worst are a concern to all and require a strong response. But we need to realize it's not a game when fan intensity, alcohol and trash-talk collide with the dignity of peoples who have been marginalized in their own country.There is a lot of attention being paid to calls for reconciliation in this country. Reconciliation begins with respect for one another and acknowledgement that indigenous peoples are people - not cartoon mascots with cute-sounding nicknames.Schools and leagues around the country have shown courage in changing their team names and mascots. Those that do not are on the wrong side of history.Baseball creates employment, fosters community spirit and provides food we can't get enough of. But the recent behaviour of some fans, along with Cleveland's team name and symbols, remind us that sports can also be a place of prejudice.We may not be able to change Cleveland's team name and logo today, but we can do our part here at home by advocating for the end of indigenous mascots on Canadian teams.Reconciliation requires hard work. Ditching race-based indigenous sports teams' names is comparatively easy.As we draw closer to celebrating Canada's 150th birthday, we must turn the page on this part of professional sports and create the next chapter in Canada's history, together. Go Jays! Go Canada!, Trace the trajectories of the Canadian and American conservative parties and you will find significant similarities. Since the 1980s, the more raw-boned elements in our Conservatives and their Republicans have each asserted control. The fallout is still being felt.In Destiny and Power: The American Odyssey of George Herbert Walker Bush, Jon Meacham's adulatory book on the first president Bush, you get a sense of the dramatic shift on the Republican side. What a gentleman was papa George, compared with the Grand Old Party's current preachers and screechers. The Republicans have gone from a temperate lot to Tea Party hard-liners to the tumult of the Ted Cruzes and Donald Trumps.The divisions will play out, probably brutally. A showdown between the troglodytes and the moderates is soon to happen.The Democrats also have their divisions. Semi-socialist Bernie Sanders is the most radical challenger for the crown to come along in decades. But, unlike the insult brigade on the GOP side, the Democrats are running a dignified campaign.It's in keeping with Barack Obama's high behavioural standards. David Brooks, the conservative sage at The New York Times, was pointing out in a recent column how Mr. Obama, unlike the Republicans, has a quality called class. He wrote of the Democrat President's 'integrity, humanity, good manners and elegance.'The piece hardly endeared him to GOP fellow travellers. But he, like many Americans, has been appalled by the divisiveness and rancour in Republican precincts, highlighted by what The Washington Post calls 'the utter ugliness of Donald Trump's campaign.'North of the border, Conservatives have had no shortage of experience with crass acts. Former Toronto mayor Rob Ford brought disgrace to the conservative name. Former prime minister Stephen Harper's team was noted for a long run of dirty deeds. It's the way the hard right in both countries does business. Class act isn't part of the equation.How costly has it been? After the past election, several Tories said their cause was hurt by what they gently referred to as the 'tone' problem. By tone, they mean things such as race-baiting, enemies lists and running a closed government.In the party now, things are calm under the measured, impressive interim leadership of Rona Ambrose. But don't be surprised when the leadership race moves into high gear to see a reckoning, a pitched battle between the hard right and moderates for control of the party.Critical will be to see whether the Conservatives have learned from their election experience. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's leadership illustrates how important 'tone' can be. He has been riding high, not so much because of what he has done, but how he is doing it.Writing an election post-mortem on these pages last week, Jenni Byrne, the Conservatives' campaign architect, didn't even cite the integrity issue, nor did party strategist Ken Boessenkool in an earlier appraisal. Until the past election, the party did well politically via Mr. Harper's autocratic methods. He won three of five elections, a 60-per-cent ranking. That's good, though by our historical standards not imposing, Higher winning averages were achieved by prime ministers Jean Chretien, Brian Mulroney, Pierre Trudeau, Louis St. Laurent, Mackenzie King, Robert Borden, Wilfrid Laurier and John A. Macdonald.Ms. Byrne said it was the country's mood for change that brought on the recent defeat and expressed confidence that the party can win back power in 2019. If history is any guide, that will be a mighty tall order. New leaders who come to power in Canada with a majority almost always retain power in the following election. In the past 140 years, there has been only one exception, it being R.B. Bennett, who was felled by the Great Depression.In the United States, the Democrats have been in power almost eight years. The time-for-change argument plays to the Republicans' favour. But if they are to win, they will have to bridge their divides, a thorny task given the presence of Mr. Trump.On this side of the border, Conservatives have more time to sort out their divides and their future., Liam Kennedy holds a PhD in sociology from the University of Toronto. He studies crime, deviance, and punishment.As the body of former Toronto mayor Rob Ford lies in city hall for public visitation, we need to address our collective hypocrisy for how we treated the man's problems while he was alive.In the days following Mr. Ford's admission to smoking crack cocaine, many notable politicians, members of the news media, and citizens called for him to step down or take a leave from his mayoral duties and to get help for his addiction.At the time some regarded his behaviour as disgusting, embarrassing, and unforgivable (this is just a small sample of the pejorative adjectives employed). Mr. Ford, as we know, refused to resign and it took an additional six months and news of another crack video for him to enter a rehabilitation facility seeking treatment for his substance abuse.In the intervening period he was mocked for his weight and lack of grace, sophistication, and overall polish. And, because he failed to follow an extremely narrow pathway to recovery set out for him, he was repeatedly condemned for his lack of contrition, humility, remorse, and honour.Those labelled addicts, so this line of thinking goes, should be ashamed of their behaviour and the harm it has caused to those around them, should repent for their misdeeds, and should seek redemption through recovery (often treated as synonymous with a stint in a treatment facility). In the eyes of many, Rob Ford's decision not to follow this pathway rendered him subject to ridicule and shunning. For a city - and country - that prides itself on tolerance and diversity, sympathy and empathy were in remarkably short supply.Today, his courage, determination, and dedication to the city of Toronto are being commended by prominent political figures. Former prime minister Stephen Harper referred to him as a 'fighter,' a sentiment shared by others. In other words, many of the same qualities for which he was reviled in 2013 and 2014 are being celebrated now in the wake of his death at age 46, more than a year after first being diagnosed with a rare form of cancer.For his part, Toronto Mayor John Tory, recalled that Rob Ford was a 'profoundly human guy.' This humanity was lost far too often during the discussion of Mr. Ford's substance use. Too many of us were much too quick to moralize the issue, to attack Ford for his apparent connections to individuals involved in the drug trade, and to proclaim that his addiction could be fixed with a short stint at a Muskoka rehabilitation facility or a vacation in Florida.Only now, after his death, do we feel sorry for him and his family? Now he is worthy of sympathy? That strikes me as pretty disingenuous. Mr. Ford's death should give us pause.We should all take some time to acknowledge our hypocrisy, to remember our shared humanity not just when someone 'battles' cancer but when they struggle with addiction (or mental illness or poverty or discrimination or domestic violence), and to move forward with reasoned approaches to the complex issue of drug and alcohol abuse. The current debate about opening three safe injection sites in Toronto is a positive sign on this front, perhaps marking a shift from an unsuccessful law-and-order approach that criminalizes drug users and towards harm reduction.While this discussion is a reason for optimism, let's refrain from patting ourselves on the back for our progressiveness until we start treating all individuals with substance abuse problems with compassion and understanding., In the mid-1970s, when Yonge Street was a tawdry nirvana bisecting Toronto, my father used to leave my older brothers and I in a pinball arcade while he went record shopping. At night. For hours. I was young enough to need a plastic milk crate to stand on so I could reach the flippers.He didn't entirely abandon us, in the middle of the night, on a street full of weirdos and miscreants: He made sure we had a plastic bag full of change for the games. Then he went off to Sam the Record Man or A&As to look for opera imports. Only once did anyone in authority express any concern over three raggedy children playing Fireball 5000 or whatever the hot game of the moment was. A policeman came into the arcade and asked where our parents were, and my brother flapped a hand toward the door: 'Dad's buying records.' This seemed like a reasonable answer, so the officer left us to our pinball.Now, of course, the officer would have taken us into custody and thrown my father into jail. But it was the 1970s, and no one had a parenting philosophy beyond 'I hope they're all still alive tomorrow.' A man who chain-smoked Export As while driving his unseatbelted children in the back of the Impala did not have a finely tuned sense of danger, by today's standards. Or maybe it was perfectly well tuned, and it's the standards that have gone haywire.The unspoken principle of benign neglect that governed the lives of children in the 1970s is now called 'free-range parenting' or 'unparenting.' This movement, which has been growing for the past half-decade, is an attempt to free children from the thumb of adult oppression, at least for brief periods, thus allowing them to grow a tough outer shell. It has a new pair of martyrs, Danielle and Alexander Meitiv of Silver Spring, Md.This week, for the second time this year, the Meitivs are being investigated for behaviour relating to their kids, Rafi, 10, and Dvora, 6. Did they abandon their kids and go to the casino? Nope. Abuse them in some way? Make them watch Here Comes Honey Boo Boo over and over? No again. Their crime was letting their kids play in the park and walk home alone.After a local dog-walker spotted the unsupervised children and called 911, they were picked up and kept for hours in a police cruiser and then in custody, which the kids not surprisingly found traumatic. Possibly quite a bit more traumatic than walking home together in their nice neighbourhood.The Meitivs are repeat offenders, in the eyes of child-protection services: They'd been investigated earlier this year for letting their child run loose in the neighbourhood. In February, Danielle Meitiv defended her child-rearing principles in the Washington Post: 'Not everyone is comfortable with the idea of young children being outside without adult supervision. We're not always comfortable with it, either. We think, however, that giving them an opportunity to learn to make their way in the world independently is the best way to prepare them for adulthood - and that it is safe for them to do so.'Kids are in danger, free-rangers argue: Not from abduction, which is a minuscule threat, but from the long-term harm that comes in never learning to do anything for themselves. Their little independence glands are atrophying and will soon be as useless as an appendix. As Ms. Meitiv wrote, 'Stranger abduction, the bogeyman of most parental fears, has always been exceedingly rare. Far more hazardous are the obesity risks and idleness we subject children to if we do not allow them to run outside and play.'This penning of children like veal calves has happened in remarkably short order - really only a couple of decades. You could blame the privatization of public space, which imposes rules on formerly unruly common land, or the hyper-vigilance that has trained us to look for abuse and neglect in children, or just the concern of parents who have fewer children, and are more invested in each of them. Feel free to substitute 'ruinous paranoia' for 'concern' in the preceding sentence.At least the Meitivs are embraced by a community of like-minded child-ignorers. (I joke - you really only want to ignore your children when they ask for things like car keys, or college tuition.) Chief among their supporters is Lenore Skenazy, doyenne of the free-range movement, who was excoriated in 2008 for letting her nine-year-old son ride the New York subway by himself.I interviewed Ms. Skenazy five years ago, when I was intent on starting a free-range movement on my street - the attempt was doomed, ironically, by my inability to set enough children free. Something she said then has stuck with me ever since: 'Can you imagine a headline in the 1970s that said, 'Kids Play in Park, Experts Astounded.' '?Or 'kids play in park, parents investigated for abuse.' The Meitivs have said they're considering a lawsuit against the authorities in Maryland. I'm sure that if my father were still around he'd donate to their cause, or at least give their kids some quarters so they could go out and play video games in an arcade, as nature intended., There comes a moment in some of our lives when a dear friend will succumb to the siren song of Dr. Wrinkle-Free, the cosmetic surgeon. That friend will present herself at the door, and you can either swallow your horror and acknowledge this new wax person, or you can shriek, 'My God, Marjorie, what have you done to your face?'I think all of Ottawa had a collective 'My God, Marjorie' moment when the proposed addition to the Chateau Laurier hotel was unveiled this week. The boxy refurbishment was less a subtle nip-and-tuck than a jarring mash-up, as if they'd stuck a nose ring on the Mona Lisa (it may be generous to compare the hotel to the Mona Lisa, but Ottawa - how to put this gently - does not exactly bristle with landmark architecture.)Related: The Parliament buildings are getting an expensive faceliftGlobe editorial: 24 Sussex Drive is your house too, and it needs to be repairedThe criticism of the planned extension was quick and, for Ottawa, brutal. 'Is this a joke?' was a common reaction online, along with the suggestion that the new addition, designed by Toronto architect Peter Clewes, had been inspired by the online game Minecraft. The hotel's copper roof and Indiana limestone are reflected in the proposed design, but not its grandeur or whimsy; the whole effect is a bit Condoland 2016. Ottawa's mayor, Jim Watson, suggested on Twitter that all parties involved 'go back to the drawing board.'You can bet there will be drawing boards, and public consultations with 'stakeholders' - i.e., meetings with annoyed citizens drinking rancid coffee from paper cups - and eventually some kind of compromise will be met that services the twin gods of commerce and good taste. Every city that has the luck to grow and flourish experiences these tensions.This is even more true in a country that's so young it doesn't really possess a unified architectural vernacular, and jealously guards the bits we've borrowed from other cultures. In Toronto, Daniel Libeskind's spiked glass extension to the Royal Ontario Museum still causes people to shake with rage. (I personally love its punky exuberance, but I'm in the minority.) Only 20 years ago, Moshe Safdie's Vancouver Public Library, an over-the-top wink at a Roman colosseum that won a public popularity contest, divided the hoi polloi and the architecture critics. The public loved it; critics not so much.Buildings, and their additions, can slowly warm even the most hostile hearts: It's hard to remember that many of the places we most treasure, from Frank Lloyd Wright's Guggenheim Museum in New York to I.M. Pei's pyramid addition to the Louvre, were initially held in contempt. I'm not saying that's the case with the box they're trying to fix on the side of this hotel, only that architecture is long, and outrage is short.The Chateau Laurier is, like other dowagers needing a touch-up, the victim of its own success. Its owners, Larco Investments, want to expand the hotel by 200 rooms, adding suites and new underground parking. There's no doubt the old girl needs to shake the Labrador hair off her skirts, but you don't want to turn her into a Kardashian overnight. There's only so much Ottawa's heart can take.The Globe wrote approvingly about the magnificence of the Chateau Laurier when it opened on June 2, 1912, at a cost of $2-million: 'The latest word in palace hotels on this continent in point of chaste and impressive architecture, in point of beauty of interior decorations, and in point of completeness of arrangements for the comfort and convenience of guests was spoken last night. ...' The Chateau Laurier, with its palm-room, its writing-corridor and its ladies' parlours, 'has admirably succeeded in getting away from the conventional hotel-like and un-homelike stiffness of most modern hotels.'That's a lot of history and public affection to be up against. A beloved building, even one that you pass a hundred times a month and rarely give a second thought, is like the face of that friend you take for granted until it's gone, or irrevocably changed. Then your shared story has been rewritten, and history lost, and no one even asks permission. You can see why people fume.Not too long ago I stood in a crowded room to hear public consultations about the housing development that would replace Honest Ed's, which is a giant, gaudy, discombobulating Toronto discount store that people love more in theory than in practice. I can pretty much guarantee that none of the people in that room shopped at Honest Ed's, but you would think that their children were being sold for meat, they were so incensed. (More people should shop there, because it is the bazaar of the bizarre, and cheap to boot. Last week I noticed a silver casket for sale, under a hand-painted sign that read, 'No Exit.' This is not the sort of thing you find at Holt Renfrew.)Even if they didn't shop at Honest Ed's, the people in that room felt a stake in the way the city was preserved, in how it looks, in the story it tells about itself. It's the same way that people in Ottawa must feel about the Chateau Laurier. How can you say goodbye to the face of an old friend?, Just what is a dignified death?Proponents of assisted suicide constantly evoke the 'right to die with dignity' in seeking a Supreme Court of Canada ruling striking down Criminal Code provisions banning the practice. What they really mean is that they want to control the circumstances of their own deaths.This is an an entirely legitimate desire, and the Supreme Court should grant them their wish. It's a free country, after all, and our Charter right to life and liberty surely includes the right to choose when and how to end it all.But to suggest that ending one's life with the help of a doctor or loved one is the 'dignified' way to go is as shallow as it is hubristic. We come into this world helpless and, traditionally, most of us have gone out of it that way. That's not undignified. It's one of the things that makes us human.Being human means admitting that we're often powerless to control the curveballs life throws at us and the people we love. All we can do is try and learn from them. This is anathema to baby boomers. Brainwashed by self-help books into believing they can control everything, they somehow forgot they were mortal. As they face their final decades, it's hitting them like a brick.No wonder B.C. psychotherapist Gillian Bennett's recent suicide note struck such a chord with Canadians. Ms. Bennett chose to end her life before her dementia progressed to the stage of 'not knowing who I am.' She would have preferred waiting so that her husband could help her die when she got closer to 'gaga.' But the law still forbids that, and she wanted to outrun her disease before it outran her.'I can live or vegetate for perhaps 10 years in hospital at Canada's expense ... It is ludicrous, wasteful and unfair,' the 85-year-old great-grandmother wrote. 'As we, the elderly, undergo manifold operations and become gaga while taking up a hospital bed, our grandchildren's schooling, their educational, athletic and cultural opportunities, will be squeezed dry.'Of all the reasons to back assisted suicide, this is perhaps the worst and most dangerous.The fact that we've organized our health-care system incoherently should not make chronic-care patients feel guilty about occupying scarce acute-care hospital beds. For every dollar our health-care system might save if more ALS, Alzheimer's, multiple sclerosis or terminal cancer patients ended their lives prematurely, we'd all lose a bit more of our humanity.Our shifting demographics makes clear the need to reorganize our health-care system. Just 16 per cent of terminally ill Canadians have access to quality palliative care. And the majority of Canadian medical schools offer fewer than 10 hours of palliative-care training to new doctors. Until that changes, more dying Canadians will see assisted suicide as the 'dignified' way to go. This is the opposite of social progress.Of course, we suffer when others suffer. But if a fatal diagnosis routinely becomes an invitation to assisted suicide, we are devaluing one of the most important parts of life - its ending. Given our modern medicine, no terminally ill patient should have to experience unbearable physical pain. The duress, for patients and their loved ones, is mostly psychological. And it scares us silly.For many, such suffering is needless and pointless and they will never be persuaded otherwise. The law should be changed to accommodate them. But you don't have to be religious to feel that the dying - even gaga ones - pass on meaningful lessons to the living.Think of Mrs. Henry Lafayette Dubose, the crotchety morphine addict from Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird. Atticus Finch forces his son Jem to read to her daily to ease her through her withdrawal symptoms, as she seeks to 'die free.''I wanted you to see what real courage is,' Atticus tells Jem afterward. '... It's when you know you're licked before you begin but you begin anyway and you see it through no matter what. You rarely win, but sometimes you do. Mrs. Dubose won ... She was the bravest person I ever knew.'Real life is not always so poignant, of course. It's raw and painful and its meaning is not always immediately apparent. But as humbling as a disease can be, it is never undignified to stick it out., No one talks about the possibility of the working-class party forming the next government. The NDP has never reached the top. It's regarded as the stuff of pipe dreams. Prior to the last election, no one talked about it becoming the Official Opposition. It never had reached that perch either - until that election campaign played out.To take the historic next step, the New Democrats don't need the great gains they made in that 2011 campaign. They need only about 20 more seats from their current 95. That would give them 115 which conceivably could be enough to form a slim minority.Brad Lavigne, who served as principal secretary to the late Jack Layton, was one of the architects of the remarkable - some would call it flukey - 2011 surge. He left the orange wave team, but NDP leader Thomas Mulcair recently brought him back to be his senior campaign adviser.During a 90-minute discussion, Mr. Lavigne spent most of the time targeting the Liberals, dismissively referring to them as 'the third party,' the designation his own flock laboured under so long. He left the impression that NDP guns will be concentrated less on the Conservatives than Justin Trudeau, who will be painted as a naive, inexperienced candidate of non-change. All this could suit Stephen Harper very nicely. A dogfight among progressives! Bring it on.The NDP strategist was enthused about internal polling - all parties tend to boast about their internal polling - showing an 11-point lead over the third party on matters related to standing up for Mr. and Mrs. Mainstreet.Call it working class or middle class, it is all the NDP cares about. 'Every one of our policies will be seen through that lens,' said Mr. Lavigne. 'Tom Mulcair is going to hammer that home. If it's good for the middle class, it's an NDP policy.'In policy terms, this means a big child-care program, keeping the retirement age at 65 for benefits, hiking the minimum wage in areas where possible. Over the next few months, said Mr. Lavigne, the party will bring on new job creation plans, more measures to combat climate change, plans to restore democracy to a system overrun by one-man rule.Internal polling shows that Mr. Mulcair is least known among the leaders, but Mr. Lavigne sees this as 'a wonderful opportunity.' When voters get to know him, they'll know where he is coming from. The Prime Minister is a career politician, he noted, while Justin Trudeau was brought up 'rubbing shoulders with kings and queens.' And so 'you contrast our leader's value set. He is the second oldest of 10 kids. He didn't have a trust fund left to him. His family pursued the middle class dream in Canada.'There's that and there's his long years of experience - and there will be a campaign based on hope not fear.Mr. Lavigne sees the NDP vote as being committed while 'the third party vote is very loose. Blow a little and the whole thing falls over.'The strategist talks a good game. I remind him his party is almost 10 points down in the polls since the last election and is falling in Quebec. An Ekos survey, for example, shows a close four-party fight in the province. That would mean the NDP, which won 59 seats in Quebec in the last election, could lose a whopping 20-30 of them in that province alone. So long pipe dream.The Lavigne response? 'Polls don't forecast an outcome.' The last election result told him that. But can the New Democrats pull off two electoral shocks in a row? Their optimism lies in the belief that the Liberals are riding high on a celebrity name alone, that their support will collapse in the campaign and that the vote for change will coalesce under the NDP banner.Blow a little and the whole Trudeau edifice falls over. If it happens, the chance of the working-class party winning government is within reach., The Ontario Liberal government's ambitious 'Draft Climate Change Action Plan,' the text of which was leaked to The Globe and revealed on Monday, left us scratching our heads. The problem is not the ambition: Ontario has rightly pledged to reduce greenhouse gases, with 1990 emission levels to be cut by 15 per cent in 2020, 37 per cent by 2030 and 80 per cent by 2050. Those targets won't be easy to achieve, but if the science on global warming is right (we think it is), and if the international commitments that Canada and much of the world have signed onto mean anything (they should), then a long-term plan to steadily reduce greenhouse gas output is necessary.It's not Ontario's low-carbon destination that has amber lights flashing. It's the road it is choosing to get there.Governments are terrible at central planning. They aren't any good at micromanaging an economy, because they don't have enough information to do it as efficiently as millions of consumers and companies, each of whom can size up their own costs and savings opportunities, while adjusting to constantly changing price signals. That's why most economists think the most efficient way to achieve a big social objective like reducing carbon emissions is to put a price on carbon and let citizens and businesses, through billions of individual decisions, figure out how best to lower their carbon costs. Unfortunately, Ontario's Liberal government appears to be cribbing from a different textbook.The strategy laid out in the draft climate action strategy calls for Queen's Park to cajole or financially bribe Ontarians into or out of various forms of energy. The big objectives in the plan are to be achieved by subsidies, or flat-out government orders.For example, 76 per cent of Ontario homes are currently heated with natural gas. The Liberals are proposing to offer subsidies 'of up to $20,000' to anyone purchasing a new home using electricity, rather than gas. That's the carrot. The government also wants new building regulations, which by 2030 will make it against the law to heat new homes with natural gas. There's the stick.Switching millions of homes from natural gas to electricity is not technically difficult; it simply involves building more electricity-generating facilities and more transmission lines. But it won't be cheap. And that's the issue: How much will it cost - and is it the most cost-effective way of reducing greenhouse gas emissions?Ontario also says that, within eight years, it wants every two-car household to have at least one electric vehicle, and it wants new car buyers to be 'encouraged' to go electric when buying their first car. The highway to that destination will be paved with taxpayer dollars. Electric car buyers will get a subsidy of 'up to $14,000 per vehicle' and 'up to $1,000' per home-charging station. There will be extra cash for low-income electric buyers, plus no sales tax on electric vehicles. And electric car owners will get free electricity if they charge up overnight.Again, all of this is technically possible. Subsidizing hundreds of thousands of electric cars; building billions of dollars' worth of upgrades to the transmission grid; free electricity, paid for by taxpayers - it's all doable. But everything comes at a cost. Voters should be asking whether this is the low-cost route to a low-carbon future, or a high-cost detour that, by abusing society's most finite resource - the wealth of its taxpayers - will actually end up making it harder to reach that low-carbon future.Some skepticism about the Great Electric Leap Forward is in order. The Ontario Liberals are, remember, the government behind the last attempt at remaking the electricity system - which was so poorly conceived and so little understood by its architects that it turned the province into North America's leader in overpriced power. According to the provincial Auditor-General, consumers and businesses have overpaid for electricity by $37-billion over the past eight years, and will overpay by another $133-billion by 2032.Those costs have put not one extra cent into provincial coffers. The province simply figured out how to make electricity production more inefficient. Taxpayers and ratepayers will be footing the bill for decades.But Ontario's last energy fiasco does provide at least one lesson the government should be taking to heart: Consumers pay attention to prices. Over the past decade, Ontario's population has risen by 10 per cent and real economic output is up 14 per cent - but in the face of skyrocketing electricity costs, power consumption has fallen 13 per cent. When people are charged more for something, they will figure out how to use less of it. They don't need the government to order them to do it.Instead of trying so hard to impersonate Soviet central planning, it would be better if Ontario put more emphasis on reducing carbon by taxing it. Consumers are usually better placed than central planners to read the price signals and figure out how best to save energy - and save their own money., The outrage from the Opposition over a standing committee's hearings into how Canadians learn about their history is overwrought and somewhat naive. Where critics see a manipulation of our past for political purposes, calmer heads see a legitimate interest in how this country is portrayed to the people who live here, and a concern that Canadians understand the sacrifices made by their ancestors. Furthermore, history is constantly being rewritten, and any public discussion about that is a good thing.The House of Commons Heritage Committee began hearings on Monday, but only after its Conservative-dominated membership dropped a plan to study how history is taught in schools. This was a sensible decision, as education is a provincial jurisdiction. The committee, however, is proceeding with a review of what it considers to be 'significant aspects in Canadian history' and how they are commemorated in federal programs and elsewhere outside of schools. This is a perfectly legitimate undertaking by such a committee.Critics are using the hearings to contend that an emphasis by the Harper government on Canada's many military accomplishments, such as the recent celebrations of the War of 1812, are a partisan effort to remake the country in the Conservatives' image. But that's an absurd contention. How are any such commemorations a partisan matter? Did liberals not die alongside conservatives in the trenches of the First World War? Many of the young soldiers in any of the wars very likely had no party affiliation.The first day of hearings included testimony from a man who was concerned that he couldn't find adequate information about Canadian soldiers' participation in the Allied landings in Sicily during the Second World War. More than 500 Canadians were killed during the liberation of Sicily, yet the public knows little about this fact. Is it a partisan desire to see such sacrifices properly commemorated?The Conservatives are not rewriting history; rather, they are interested in making sure Canadians understand that the rights and freedoms we enjoy are a precious inheritance that deserves celebration. If anything, this interest is an act of nation-building that should be embraced.Writing a nation's history takes time; the historical significance of the Harper government will not be fully understood or clearly written for a number of decades. But surely, when that does happen, it will not include a condemnation of a standing committee's desire to discuss the accepted wisdom of the day about Canada's past, and whether the federal government, within the boundaries of its jurisdictions, might want to highlight overlooked events., In the summer of 2010, more than 200 institutions and individuals asked Stephen Harper's government not to eliminate the long-form census.They represented a Who's Who of experts in statistics. All sorts of groups, from B'nai Brith to business associations and trade unions, argued that the long-form census, which required some, but only some, citizens by law to answer questions for Statistics Canada, was essential for presenting the most accurate statistical profile of Canadians.To no avail. The Prime Minister had made up his mind. His hapless minister, Tony Clement, had to toe the line. He did so in such a way as to misstate the true views of the head of Statistics Canada, who resigned in protest.It is worth recalling that assault on basic information and disregard for expertise now that more than 150 political scientists, including some of the most eminent in Canada, not to mention the head of Elections Canada, have urged the government to reconsider some of the key provisions of its Fair Elections Act.The very name is a misnomer, as the critics have argued. It will not make elections fairer; indeed, it will likely produce the reverse.Recall the process before considering the bill's provisions. Democracy and elections do not belong to any party. Organizing them is not the responsibility of the government of the day.Therefore, the proper way to proceed in updating the election law is to a) ask the office that knows the most about elections, that is Elections Canada; b) ask an all-party committee to study the issues. The way not to proceed is to have an elections bill drafted by the government, rammed through the Commons on second reading, then sent to committee, where the government's majority will prevail.This is how the government is proceeding, led by Minister for Democratic Reform Pierre Poilievre, a young man who leaped into the cabinet principally for his leather-lunged abilities at partisan verbal jousting. Anyone who believes Mr. Poilievre can act on just about anything without the interests of the Conservative Party at heart has not been observing his career thus far. Unbridled partisanship has its place in politics, one supposes, but not for updating elections law.As Prof. Paul Thomas of the University of Manitoba (and a member of the Elections Canada advisory board) pointed out in a paper he wrote about the proposed changes, Britain's electoral commission was extensively consulted before changes to the law. Here, Mr. Poilievre said he spent an hour with Chief Electoral Officer Marc Mayrand before drafting the bill. Obviously, he did not highly value Mr. Mayrand's analysis during their brief meeting, since the Chief Electoral Officer just dumped all over important parts of the bill before the parliamentary committee.Prof. Thomas also explained that 2011 public-opinion surveys reveal a high level of confidence in Elections Canada. Eighty-five per cent of eligible voters felt Elections Canada ran a fair election in May, 2011.The Conservative Party, however, was mad at Mr. Mayrand, because the elections office had caught the party out on the 'in-and-out' scheme, which involved circumventing election spending rules, and in the robocalls affair. So the Conservatives set about, as they do with those whom they decide are 'enemies,' to weaken the powers of Elections Canada.This weakening is among the issues that has the 150-plus political scientists up in arms. They highlight that the new bill would move enforcement from the commissioner of elections under Elections Canada to the director of public prosecutions, who reports to the government, not Parliament.The bill would exempt fundraising costs from campaign expenses as long as the fundraising is directed at those who have given more than $20 in the past. This is clearly designed to assist the Conservatives, who have more donors and already raise more money.The bill would eliminate vouching - taking an oath if standard forms of voter identification are not available. This change could disenfranchise some of the poorest citizens. The bill would also prevent - and this is simply crazy - Elections Canada from encouraging people to vote, leaving this effort entirely up to political parties.There are other dubious parts of this ill-considered bill. Will the critics, who know a great deal about elections and have no partisan axes to grind, be heeded? We can only hope., In his book Believer, David Axelrod tells of Barack Obama's 'Yes we can!' moment.Mr. Axelrod, the Obama image guy, liked the phrase because it gave voters a stake in making change happen. He put it in as the closing line for one of Mr. Obama's ads. But when the candidate saw it, he wasn't overly impressed. ' 'Yes we can.' Is that too corny?' the future president asked. His wife, Michelle, was seated on a staircase. 'Meesh, what do you think?''Not corny,' she said.And thereafter, 'Yes we can!' became the rallying cry for the Obama presidential campaign.But in office, Mr. Obama hasn't governed with that kind of emotional outreach. In his engaging and enlightening book, Mr. Axelrod reveals a liberal idealist who is the 'ultimate rationalist.' Mr. Obama is 'preternaturally cool,' he says, but has at times shown 'a hint of moral superiority' that hasn't done him any favours.Mr. Axelrod teamed up with the young Mr. Obama when he was unknown because 'he addressed my growing sense of alienation from politics.'In Canadian terms, with his rationalism, his hauteur, his cool, Mr. Obama has character traits reminiscent of Pierre Trudeau. Anyone wondering why Canada-U.S. relations have fallen into a state of 'No we can't' need only know that. Mr. Obama is Stephen Harper's opposite - operationally, stylistically and ideologically.U.S. ambassador Bruce Heyman is being frozen out. Mr. Obama's man in Ottawa can't even get meetings with cabinet ministers. There are several bilateral irritants, but the White House refusal to approve the Keystone XL pipeline is at the heart of the matter. And that goes right to the philosophical differences between the men at the top. Mr. Obama is an environmentalist; Mr. Harper is not.There's a common thread to Canada-U.S. relations. Whenever presidents and prime ministers are of differing political persuasions, they tend to clash and bilateral relations inevitably worsen. Witness Jean Chretien's fireworks with George W. Bush, compared to his harmony with fellow liberal Bill Clinton. Witness Mr. Trudeau's compatibility with Jimmy Carter, compared to his strained rapport with Richard Nixon.Witness John F. Kennedy's confrontations with Tory John Diefenbaker, versus his warm embrace of Lester Pearson. Liberals Franklin Roosevelt got along famously with Mackenzie King - not so with R.B. Bennett.So the surprise shouldn't be that relations are not good under Mr. Obama and Mr. Harper - but that they aren't a lot worse. Mr. Harper must think he's dealing with another Trudeau, while Mr. Obama must think he's dealing with another hard-right Republican, especially when the PM lectured him on Keystone, saying he wouldn't take no for an answer.The two men do have one thing in common: They both win. Writing about Mr. Obama's takedown of the Republicans in 2008, Mr. Axelrod offers up some campaign strategy that Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau might wish to bear in mind: ' 'Barack's bet' was that 'candour was better than pander.' While he wasn't above the pleasing line, he understood that you could not wage war against conventional politics by acting conventionally.'The book serves as another indicator of where Canada stands on Washington's priority list. There isn't one mention of Mr. Harper. The Prime Minister's anger at the neglect from this White House is understandable, especially on the Keystone file. Although Mr. Axelrod writes about how the President detests everything being reduced to raw political calculation, his partisan political interests sure seem to be in play on Keystone.The larger consideration with Mr. Obama, though, is obviously his other work. The United States is certainly a lot better off under him than it was under Mr. Bush and Dick Cheney. After the ill-conceived ideological muscle-flexing of those gentlemen, the ultimate rationalist was the tonic.As Mr. Axelrod contends, Mr. Obama brought the country back from the brink., In December, Philippe Couillard, until then a rather pragmatic but not overzealous supporter of environmentalism, went to the Paris Climate Change conference and came back repainted in green. The Quebec Premier had been left starstruck by Al Gore.The former U.S. vice-president and outspoken crusader had showered Mr. Couillard with laudatory comments about Quebec's record on the environment and had praised Mr. Couillard's 'fantastic leadership' on the issue. 'Quebec shows the way,' Mr. Gore intoned after Mr. Couillard announced that the province would donate $25.5-million to help poor francophone countries fight climate change.So Mr. Couillard was still in seventh heaven when a reporter asked him why his government had a share in an exploration project on Anticosti Island, a sparsely populated natural reserve in the St. Lawrence River believed to contain vast reserves of oil and gas. Mr. Couillard, brutally brought back down to earth, erupted. 'That's not my project. I'm fed up with it. I would rather have not found it on my desk.'The contract between the province and several energy companies was signed by the Parti Quebecois government shortly before the Liberals came to power, but - without enthusiasm - the Couillard government followed through. But, since the Paris conference, Mr. Couillard has started publicly attacking a project that is still subject to environmental studies. So far, Hydrocarbures Anticosti, which represents three companies and the government, has done 12 surveys and intends to drill in three spots this summer by fracking in order to evaluate the reserves' potential. This month, Mr. Couillard said he would 'do everything to prevent drilling on the island.' The door, he warned, is 'not even narrowly open.'Alexandre Gagnon, the CEO of Petrolia, one of the consortium's companies, has been left in the dark. Nobody returns his calls. 'It's pretty weird,' he told La Presse. 'You're in business with a partner who keeps talking against the deal in public but refuses to talk to you.' However, he said people at Ressources Quebec, the group supervising the project, told him that everything is going ahead as planned. Quebec has invested $13-million in the project and is committed to a total of $57-million. Mr. Gagnon said the contract contains no withdrawal clause.Still, Le Devoir has reported that 'members of the government' have been covertly encouraging environmental groups to publish studies detrimental to the Anticosti project. Environment Minister David Heurtel did not deny the story. 'All environmentalists should take part in the public debate,' he said.The business community worries that the Premier's abrupt flip-flop will hurt Quebec's reputation in financial markets. 'What looked certain is not any more. This uncertainty will be very damaging,' said Francoise Bertrand, head of Quebec's Federation of Chambers of Commerce.Andy Gustajtis, a Toronto banker who helped Junex, another oil company, raise money for projects in Quebec, is more direct. 'It's plain stupid,' he told La Presse. 'If you say to someone you don't want their money ... they'll go where they're welcome.'Mr. Gore should have minded his words. Too much praise can go to some people's heads., 'Where the bee sucks, there suck I.' William Shakespeare, The Tempest.The CBC has a new member of its board of directors. The Conservatives have appointed 35-year-old Rob Jeffery. He is a Halifax chartered accountant. He is senior director of taxation for Sobey's, a leading food retailer. You may be wondering what other compelling qualifications the young man has to preside over the state broadcaster in our complex, ever-changing media world?Well, there is something else. He recently served two terms as treasurer for the Progressive Conservative Party of Nova Scotia.It hardly requires a stretch of the imagination to reason that he got the appointment because he's been a loyal worker for the party who will likely do its bidding in the further emasculation of the CBC which, as we know, is not one of the Prime Minister's most favoured entities.Mr. Jeffery shouldn't be singled out. He is only one of countless numbers who, courtesy of our well-entrenched practice of patronage, get lovely appointments without having much in the way of qualifications. It's what the spoils system is all about. The gravy train. It's a problem much, much broader than Senate appointments.The system, as detailed years ago in Jeffrey Simpson's book, Spoils of Power, has been part and parcel of every government, not just Stephen Harper's. Most every government comes to power promising to clean it up and then does nothing to clean it up.But if there is some good to come from all the stench arising from the Senate scandal, it is that it may be generating enough public disgust to force real change.Patronage was big news back in the 1980s, when Brian Mulroney knocked over John Turner with his celebrated 'You had an option, sir!' castigation of the former Liberal leader's decision to countenance Pierre Trudeau's last-minute spurt of appointments of party members to cushy jobs.The gravy train didn't stop under Mr. Mulroney or Jean Chretien. As a young Reform Party backbencher, Stephen Harper sounded like he wanted change. 'We don't think as a party that patronage has any place in the Parliament of Canada,' he said in 1995. In 2005, as leader of the Official Opposition, he went further, stating that patronage 'has got to stop, and when we become government, it will stop.'And actually he did have a fine idea to halt it, or at least slow it down. When he came to power in 2006, he created an arm's-length Public Appointments Commission to handle the thousands of appointments the government makes. But it never got off the ground. Mr. Harper couldn't get the opposition parties to approve of his nomination to chair the commission and so he went back to the old way and patronage is now as rampant as ever.The Senate presents a special patronage problem because governments need Red Chamber support to get their legislation passed. This has led to the blatant favouritism in Senate appointments. If elected, the NDP and Liberals promise change. The New Democrats, who don't have any senators, vow to abolish the chamber. The question is how? And how, without any senators, they will get legislation passed in the meantime is an intriguing question as well. As for Justin Trudeau, he has cut party ties to all Liberal senators, hoping in this way to create a more independent chamber.As for taking action on the broader scourge of patronage, Tom Mulcair promises to create an independent public appointments commission, the discarded Harper idea. Much would depend on the degree of independence such a commission would have. In the case of Mr. Trudeau, beyond his laudable Senate initiative, we haven't heard much. But he would be wise to stake out a big committment for patronage reform soon.With the Senate fiasco, the time is ripe to take down the spoils system, a blight that has been with us since the dawn of time, which is a tad too long., Here's some bad news from the world of education: Math scores are in decline across Canada. Just as kids in Poland and Portugal and other formerly disadvantaged countries are taking great leaps forward, ours are going backward. Our high schools are graduating kids who have failed to grasp the fundamentals, and our universities are full of students who are struggling to master material they should have learned in high school.What's gone wrong isn't a mystery. For the past decade and more, school systems across the country have been performing a vast experiment on your children. They have discarded 'rote' learning in favour of 'discovery,' a process by which students are supposed to come up with their own solutions to the mysteries of arithmetic. There's ample evidence that this approach leaves millions of kids (to say nothing of their parents) baffled and confused, and it is being abandoned in large parts of the United States. This has not deterred legions of Canadian education theorists and consultants from pressing on. Perhaps they're secretly in league with Kumon and Sylvan to drum up business.Ontario Education Minister Liz Sandals thinks she knows why scores are slipping. Most elementary school teachers have backgrounds in the liberal arts. Their acquaintance with math is sketchy at best. (Ms. Sandals, no slouch with numbers, has a masters degree in math.) And teachers' college doesn't give them enough grounding. 'We need to deal with math so that the teachers have the same comfort level with teaching math that they do with reading and writing,' she said last week.Actually, the problem is much deeper than that. The teachers may be clueless, but the methods they're supposed to use are bound to fail. The curriculum has downgraded arithmetic to near-invisibility. The 'progressive' approach to instruction guarantees that many students will not master basic skills, will not understand fractions, will not learn to multiply or divide two-digit numbers on their own. After all, that's what calculators are for!'Provincial curriculum guides and math textbooks have been systematically expunged of the standard algorithms,' Manitoba teacher Michael Zwaagstra, a leading education critic, told me. An algorithm is simply a rule that tells you how to do stuff. For example, how do you add 2,368 and 9,417? If you learned the standard way, you'll stack the numbers and start adding from the right: 8+7=15, carry the 1 and so on.That may be efficient, but it's hopelessly uncreative. With 'discovery' math, kids are encouraged to reinvent the wheel by, say, starting on the left, adding the thousands, then the hundreds, then the tens and ones, and adding them all up at the end. Then they have to write a story about how they got the answer. Needless to say, this takes a whole lot longer.The trouble is that math is built on fundamentals. If you miss a building block, you're likely to become progressively confused. To make things worse, the current practice of social promotion - moving kids from grade to grade even if they're hopelessly at sea - guarantees that armies of youngsters whose parents can't afford Kumon will be left in the dark. So much for equality in education.For years, math professors at our leading universities have been telling elementary and high-school educators that their methods don't work. But the educators and the teachers' colleges have refused to listen. After all, what do the professors know? They're just math geeks. They have no idea how to teach children. As a consequence, there is now an almost total disconnect between the math that's taught in most schools and the math that students need in university or the real world in order to succeed. It's notable that educators in Eastern Europe and Asia, in particular, are astounded by what they've seen happening in North America.So maybe those sinking test scores are a good thing. The education establishment may be immune to public pressure, but politicians are not. In Manitoba, where math professors and parents have been up in arms, the government has announced a bold new policy - it's bringing back arithmetic! 'Let's face it,' Education Minister Nancy Allan told the Winnipeg Free Press, 'doing math in your head is important.'As for parents who don't live in Manitoba, not all is lost. You can lobby, too. You can look up the Khan Academy on YouTube, which offers very good instructional videos for free. Or there's Kumon and its ilk. Wouldn't it be nice if our schools could put them out of business?, Wedge politics is a dangerous tactic, especially when it involves an attack on minorities. Unfortunately, it also often works.Since the Parti Quebecois government announced, through calculated leaks to sympathetic tabloids, its intention to prohibit public-service workers from wearing religious symbols and articles of faith, it has gained five points in the polls. (Part of the gain may be due to Premier Pauline Marois's efficient and compassionate response to the Lac-Megantic disaster.)The full text of the so-called Charter of Quebec Values won't be known until Sept. 9, but the explosive debate is already in full force, with the population and opinion-makers divided into two camps.The issue doesn't pit sovereigntists against federalists, although the project plays on the old-style, defensive nationalism that has always brought powerful ammunition to the sovereigntist movement. Many left-leaning or libertarian sovereigntists are adamantly opposed to the project, including the leftist Quebec Solidaire party, which has two MNAs.It's also a debate between Montreal, the cosmopolitan metropolis, and the outlying areas that are the quasi-exclusive domain of old-stock francophones - the irony being that those with the least exposure to the kippa and the niqab are the charter's most enthusiastic proponents, while Montreal City Council, which includes some prominent sovereigntists, unanimously passed a motion asking the government to 'back off' its rigid policy.Meanwhile, the populist media are joyfully stoking the flames, manufacturing a 'crisis' with little basis in Montrealers' daily life. And, social media overflows with frightful anecdotes about the worst abuses of radical Islam, suggesting that this is Quebec's future if it continues to tolerate Muslim religious customs.In Quebec, as in France, secularism often serves as a screen for plain xenophobia. Marine Le Pen, leader of France's far-right Front National, constantly invokes the tradition of laicite to justify anti-immigrant policies. In Quebec, the discovery of the concept dates from around 2007, coinciding with the rise of Muslim immigration and a few incidents involving unreasonable demands by fundamentalists.Brandishing the noble principle of equality between men and women is another way to cover Islamophobia with a politically correct varnish. It's actually the stated goal of the PQ project. So what if banning the veil (seen as a symbol of female submission) from the public sector means that practising Muslim women will be barred from the best jobs - let alone nurses, educators and other professionals whose work usually takes place in public institutions.For good measure, the future charter will also ban religious signs like kippas, turbans and oversized crosses - but in the National Assembly, the deputies will go on making laws under the guiding light of the crucifix that was installed there in 1936 by Maurice Duplessis, the arch-Catholic premier especially remembered for unabashed anti-Semitism and an infamous crackdown on Jehovah's Witnesses.This crucifix has been promoted by the government to the rank of a 'patrimonial' object, like a historic cathedral or the cross on Mount Royal. Even the previous Liberal government didn't dare remove the crucifix for fear of offending the French-Canadian majority who clings to this identity symbol even while the churches go deserted. One can only conclude that secularism is something that's good for the 'others,' not for 'nous autres.', Adam Dodek is co-director of the University of Ottawa's Public Law Group and author of the forthcoming second edition of The Canadian Constitution.----------------------------------------------When the trial of Mike Duffy began a year ago, it was clear that Canada's beleaguered Senate was just as much on trial before Justice Charles Vaillancourt as the senator was. While Mr. Duffy was found not guilty on all 31 charges, it is beyond a reasonable doubt that the Senate was convicted on Thursday.Justice Vaillancourt acquitted Mr. Duffy on many charges based on Mr. Duffy's adherence to Senate policies, procedures and practices that have now become discredited. The Senate has had three years to respond to the issues raised by the Duffy scandal. It has failed to do so.The Duffy affair could have been a catalyst for significant change in the Senate. Instead, the Senate continues to dawdle and dabble rather than having the will to embark on the sorts of reforms that are needed to have any hope of enhancing its legitimacy in the eyes of Canadians.Instead of being a change leader, the Senate has to date ceded the initiative to others: First, to the Stephen Harper Prime Minister's Office; next to the RCMP; then to former Supreme Court justice Ian Binnie; and now to the government of Justin Trudeau. When will the Senate grab the reins to drive its own chariot instead of being led around by others?To date, the Trudeau government has focused on the appointment process of senators. But it was never the process of appointing senators that created the Senate's problems, and changing the process will not rehabilitate the Senate. The problem is what they do once they get to the Senate.For the Trudeau government, changing the appointment process has multiple goals. In communications terms, it has changed the channel about the Senate and trumpeted the message of doing Senate appointments differently. Strategically, the move was meant to separate the Prime Minister from the 'independent' senators that he is appointing, and also to herald appointing more diverse senators. No change in process was required for the latter; only political will and leadership. On separating the Prime Minister from the senators he appoints, if there turns out to be another Mike Duffy amongst them, no one will care about the process that appointed them. Whatever the process, these senators are and will remain Mr. Trudeau's.Amidst all the scandals, investigations and external reforms, the Senate has remained in reactive mode. It has failed to address the core issues that gave rise to the Duffy scandal.As a senator for Prince Edward Island, Mr. Duffy has faced both mocking and criminal charges. While he may have escaped conviction in connection to his residency issues, the Senate has not. The Red Chamber has done absolutely nothing to clarify the constitutional residency requirements. This is despite having the clear constitutional powers to do so.Mr. Duffy spent much time stumping for the Conservative Party on the Senate's dime. His defence - which was ultimately accepted by the court - was that he was simply doing what the Senate allowed. The Senate responded by first bringing in the Auditor-General and then an arbitrator - Mr. Binnie. But what it has not done is overhauled its expense rules, increased its transparency and established a system of independent and regularized oversight.After Mike Duffy, if the Senate wants to really get serious about earning the trust of Canadians, it needs to take bold steps. It should end the practice of senators treating their jobs like part-time gigs and ban them from having other jobs or earning active income from speaking (as Mr. Duffy did), sitting on corporate boards (as Pamela Wallin and many other senators do) or continuing to practise their profession while serving in the Red Chamber. An effective chamber of sober second thought requires the full-time attention of all of its members. The people of Canada deserve no less.For Mr. Duffy, the verdict is an exoneration. For the Senate, it is nothing less than an indictment and a conviction on all counts. For the past three years, the Senate has failed to internalize the lessons of the Duffy scandal. The question is whether now after the verdict it will do so., Lisa Goldman is director of the Israel-Palestine Initiative at New America, a Washington-based think tank.Earlier this month, one of Israel's most famous writers announced in his weekly newspaper column that he was packing up his family and moving to the United States - permanently. Sayed Kashua, an Arab-Palestinian citizen of Israel who resides in Jerusalem, is the author of critically acclaimed novels and a popular television series, all written in Hebrew with wit and insight into the complex, conflicted society of Arabs and Jews living uneasily side-by-side. But after more than two decades of believing that ultimately Arabs and Jews would find a way to co-exist as equals, he wrote, something inside him 'had broken.' He no longer believed in a better future.Mr. Kashua's decision to emigrate came in response to a series of events that were marked by violence and incitement against the Arab population, from the government to the street. One member of the Knesset, Israel's parliament, called for a war against the Palestinian people on her Facebook page. Another called an Arab legislator a 'terrorist' during a parliamentary committee session, while still another, the leader of an ostensibly centrist party, submitted a proposal to ban an established Arab nationalist party with sitting members of the Knesset. The editor of a right-wing newspaper suggested that now was the time to transfer the Arab population out of the occupied West Bank. In Jerusalem, mobs of hyper nationalist youth rampaged through the cafe-lined downtown streets chanting 'death to Arabs,' assaulting random passersby because they looked or sounded Palestinian. Most horrifically of all, a 17 year-old Palestinian boy from East Jerusalem was abducted from the street by six young Jewish men, three of them minors. The police found Mohammed Abu Khdeir's corpse in the nearby Jerusalem Forest shortly after CCTV cameras recorded some young men forcing him into a car. He had been doused with gasoline and burned alive. Three of the six boys confessed to the crime and re-enacted it for the police.This orgy of internecine violence was sparked by the mid-June abduction of three Jewish teenage boys - Naftali Fraenkel, Gilad Shaer and and Eyal Yifrah - who were hitchhiking in the West Bank. The army carried out a massive three-week manhunt for the boys, that included pre-dawn raids and dozens of arrests; it ended with the discovery of three corpses buried in a field near Hebron. And while the men who committed the crime were almost certainly Palestinian, Hamas has vociferously denied involvement even as the Israeli government continues to accuse them of masterminding the abduction and murder as an act of terrorism.After the nationally televised funerals for the boys, with moving eulogies delivered by their mothers, the country seemed to explode. Ultra nationalists openly organized anti-Arab demonstrations via Facebook groups. In response to the murder of Abu Khdeir, the Palestinian residents of East Jerusalem demonstrated violently against even more violent paramilitary police, three of whom were filmed beating a handccuffed and unconscious Palestinian-American boy named Tariq Abu Khdeir. And then the rage spread to the Galilee, where Palestinian-Arabs (sometimes called 'Arab Israelis') came out onto the streets to demonstrate; they were met by paramilitary police who used violent crowd control methods usually reserved for the occupied territories - rubber bullets, tear gas and brutal beatings. According to Adalah, a local NGO that monitors minority civil rights in Israel, the police arrested more than 400 Arab citizens for protesting.And then the Israeli military announced its third military assault on Gaza in less than six years. The purpose of the operation, announced the government, was to destroy Hamas's military capacity, stop its military wing from launching rockets at civilian population centers, which was occurring more frequently since the army arrested Hamas members in the West Bank, and 'restore peace' to the areas of Israel that border Gaza. The vast majority of Israeli Jews support the military operation, called Protective Edge, but leftist Jews and the Arab minority organized anti-war protests, primarily in liberal Tel Aviv and then in Haifa, a mixed Arab-Jewish city.There's nothing new in seeing a minority of Israelis protest a popular war. It is not unprecedented for that minority to be met by counter-protestors who wrap themselves in the flag and call out insults like 'traitor.' But this time something new and worrying happened: Peaceful, unarmed demonstrators in Israel's two most liberal cities were physically attacked by ultra-nationalists wielding stones and bottles. In Haifa, nationalist thugs assaulted the Arab deputy mayor, slamming the middle-aged man down on the pavement. In Tel Aviv, they chased anti-war protestors into a cafe and smashed a chair over the head of one of them, even as municipal sirens wailed to announce an incoming rocket from Gaza. The police were ineffective in stopping the violence. Later, it emerged that the ultra-nationalist attackers had organized via a Facebook group managed by a well-known rap artist - a tattooed, muscular fellow who goes by the name The Shadow.Something has broken down in Israeli society. Friends who always said they would never leave because they were too deeply rooted in the place, its language and their families are deeply worried and even despairing over the radical rightward shift of the mainstream political discourse. Several have said they were looking for opportunities abroad because they couldn't see themselves raising their children in a country where dissent was slowly but surely being suppressed even as the national discourse hardened rightward.Israel has always been a flawed democracy with many festering internal divisions. Its policies toward the Arab minority reflect the unresolved tension of a conflicted identity: Should Israel aspire to be a liberal democracy or a democracy for Jews? But in the five years since Benjamin Netanyahu was elected prime minister and formed a governing coalition composed of far-right, racist and anti-democratic parties, something very fundamental has changed in Israeli society. It feels as though the majority is willing to suspend essential elements of democracy in favor of Jewish nationalism. There doesn't seem to be a place for dissent anymore., A few months ago, a Harvard senior named Reina Gattuso wrote a column in the school newspaper. It described her crummy night of drunken sex with a couple of men she didn't know. 'I have so much to drink my memory becomes dark water,' she wrote. She freely admitted that she consented. Enthusiastically. And that was the problem. She thought she would enjoy it, but instead she just felt rotten!Most people might conclude from this experience that random sex with drunken strangers is a poor idea, and Ms. Gattuso really should not try that again. Old-fashioned moralists might even call such behaviour tawdry, degrading and sluttish. Not Ms. Gattuso. And not Rebecca Traister, the New York Magazine writer who wrote about it. To them, the moral of the story is that the world is awash in bad consensual sex. This is due to the persistent power imbalances between women and men. Until we fix this, women cannot be sexually happy. As Ms. Traister argues, 'The game is rigged.'Ironically, today's feminists are serious about consent but casual about sex. And to their shock, they've discovered that there's an awful lot of bad sex out there. They did not expect this. They've been told they are supposed to be having a super-positive sex life - unconflicted, joyous, casual and abundant. They've been told they should be able to have as many partners and initiate sex just as often as men do. And they've tried that. And it hasn't worked out very well. Instead of feeling super-positive, they feel sexually dissatisfied, emotionally disconnected and more than a little used.The surprise is that so many young women are surprised by this. Haven't they watched Girls?The trouble isn't men, of course. Nor is it the culture. The trouble is that these women have been sold a lie. They've been told that the profound sexual and behavioural differences between men and women are merely matters of individual preference, which would largely dissolve if we ever managed to shed our noxious cultural baggage.Nothing could be further from the truth, of course. These differences are to a great extent hard-wired. Female sexual desire can be as powerful and urgent as men's. But most women are only able to have good sex with men they feel connected to and trust; for most men, that's not the case. Most women really do not want sex unless it might lead to commitment. Men really do not want to invest a lot of time in women unless it leads to sex. And so it goes. Women's best reproductive strategy is to be selective. Men's best reproductive strategy is to be promiscuous. As Woody Allen once wrote: 'Sex without love is an empty experience ... But as empty experiences go, it's one of the best.'Eventually men will bond with you, of course, and everything will change, and they will be willing, even eager, to faithfully protect you and your babies. But until that happens you really can't expect much from them.I know all of this is a cliche. But it's also true. Unfortunately, the emotional, behavioural, hormonal and biochemical differences between the sexes are not taught in sex ed or gender-studies courses because the truth is considered so reactionary. Some people also consider it monstrously unfair to women. Sadly, much in life is unfair. Men can pee standing up. But what can you do?Many of us learned this stuff the hard way, at the dawn of the feminist revolution. The 1970s were paradise for men. They told us that if we didn't sleep with them we must be unliberated and sexually uptight. I can't tell you how many women swallowed this cow manure before we smartened up.But now, young women are peddling this manure to themselves. In a world that's already disturbingly oversexualized, they insist that sexual display and promiscuity (dare I use that word?) are synonymous with female empowerment.These days, in fact, sexual restraint is a sign that something must be wrong with you. Last week, a young woman named Ali Rachel Pearl confessed in an essay in The New York Times that she hadn't had sex for two whole years. She can't really explain why. There was a guy who broke her heart, and so on. It turns out that this strange condition even has a name - 'secondary abstinence.' As she tells it, her friends are aghast. 'How can you go so long?' they ask. 'Get rid of your hang-ups.' 'Be more open.' 'Stop being afraid.' They all feel sorry for her.It's so old-fashioned - this bizarre notion that maybe you should feel some attachment to the person you are sleeping with. Too old-fashioned for our most progressive and enlightened young women, who, I'm afraid, are in for a world of unnecessary hurt. If only feminists would smarten up about sex, our daughters - and our sons - would be a lot better off., A political party's base is made up of the loyal voters who support it election after election, in good times and bad.  For the Conservatives, that's about 25-30 per cent of the national electorate. The 3,000 delegates who are attending the Conservative convention in Calgary represent the most active part of the base, the people who pound in lawn signs and pass out leaflets during election campaigns.On Friday night,Stephen Harper spoke to the Conservative base, and quite successfully so.  After 12 years as leader of the Canadian Alliance and Conservative Party, he knows what members want to hear.   He rehearsed all his government's achievements, emphasizing themes that the base loves, such as abolition of the long gun registry, dismantling of the Wheat Board, punishing criminals and supporting the Canadian Forces.Those in the media who speculated that he might try to explain the Senate mess that his appointments have created, and even apologize for it, have obviously not been paying attention for the last decade.  Mr. Harper explained nothing and apologized for nothing.  On the contrary, he dug in even further, calling for the speedy suspension of senators he had appointed and used so often as party fundraisers and campaigners.  In a defiant moment, he even avowed that he cared nothing for the criticism he has received, even within his own party, for ignoring considerations of due process and natural justice.The speech worked well with the people in the hall, who were on their feet repeatedly, cheering and applauding. The same approach will also work well with the base at large.There's other evidence that the Conservative base is still with Mr. Harper.  Despite misleading headlines in some newspapers, Conservative fundraising is as strong as ever.  There was a drop, as there always is, between the second and third quarters in 2013; but the party actually raised a hundred thousand dollars more in Q3 2013 than Q3 2012.  The Conservative Party is totally dependent upon grassroots donations; and if Mr. Harper ever loses the base, the results will show up very quickly in quarterly totals.  But that hasn't happened, which is great news for Mr. Harper, because a leader who loses his base is finished.But there's also some bad news.  Ever since the Liberals chose Justin Trudeau as leader, they have led in almost every national poll, and the Conservatives have been drifting down to support levels around 30 per cent, the approximate size of their base. That's enough to keep the party alive and well, but not enough to win against the resurgent Liberals.The Liberals, moreover, are finally showing they have learned how to conduct grassroots fundraising.  Why it took them ten years remains a mystery, but they seem to be getting there now.  In Q2 and Q3 of this year, they actually had more donors than the Conservatives, though the latter raised more money because their average gift was much larger.The most plausible explanation of the Liberal pattern of results - large numbers of very small donations -is that they are successfully using the Internet to harvest small gifts from the new supporters attracted during their leadership race, especially by Mr. Trudeau.  If this is indeed the trend - and no will ever tell you the whole truth in the secretive world of party fundraising - it's bad news for the Conservatives, because, with the right approach, small Liberal donors can be turned into bigger donors.Conservative fundraising was crucial in the last two elections.  The Conservatives used their financial advantage for campaigns of unanswered  negative advertising to destroy the credibility of Liberals leaders Stephane Dion and Michael Ignatieff before the writ was dropped, turning the official campaign into a mopping-up operation.  If the Liberals work their way up to financial parity with the Conservatives, a new strategy may be required.Tom Flanagan is a distinguished fellow at the School Public Policy, University of Calgary, and a former campaign manager for conservative parties., Everybody has an opinion about Kathleen Wynne's surprise election victory in Ontario. According to some experts (mostly at the National Post and in the West), the voters of Ontario are a bunch of morons. We irresponsibly rejected the path of fiscal responsibility and doubled down on the reckless wastrels who led us down the path of economic ruin. Thanks to us, our province is the drunken sailor of Confederation.Other experts (mostly at the Toronto Star) see it differently. The wise voters of Ontario have sensibly rejected the Tea Party-style politics of destruction and embraced an enlightened approach to economic management. Invest to grow! Justin Trudeau is ecstatic, and Stephen Harper had better watch out.My opinion is that voters aren't that nuanced. They voted for the gang they thought would screw things up the least. The ballot question wasn't about policies. It was about safe hands. Kathleen Wynne persuaded them that despite the ball-and-chain of the Liberal legacy, her hands were a whole lot safer than Tim Hudak's.There's a lot to be said for such a clear-cut outcome. Ms. Wynne will not have to court the NDP to stay in power. When showdown time comes with the unions - as it will - she will have a freer hand to behave firmly.Another plus is that the Conservatives will have to start over. The old Mike Harris gang is finished, and good riddance. Their message was as awful as their leader. If you're selling fiscal discipline, you also have to sell the upside - as well as the sense that you can manage through the tough times. Tim Hudak failed on both counts. All he offered was the prospect of certain chaos, and who wants that?Ms. Wynne will now have to perform a neat trick. She will have to implement her left-wing budget and then start governing from the right. She will have to start persuading the people of Ontario that although they are accustomed to jam yesterday and jam today, there will be a lot less jam tomorrow. I do not know how she will accomplish this. She will have to keep some campaign promises and break others. She will have to enforce her promise to hold the line on public-sector wage costs (good luck with that), and she will also have to find what are known euphemistically as 'new revenue streams.' This means raising taxes on hard-working people exactly like you. Surprise!There are two unpleasant truths about Ontario's economy that nobody mentioned during the election. First, politicians do not have a magical ability to create jobs, and most of the factors that have created hard times in Ontario (such as the decline of manufacturing) are mostly out of their control. Second, economic growth won't bail us out. Low growth is the new normal. Blame demographics. New workers barely outpace new retirees and immigration can't make up for that. As Douglas Porter, the Bank of Montreal's chief economist, says,'Get used to it.'Ms. Wynne has the personality traits of a good high-school principal: steady, consensual, pragmatic. But can she be strict? We shall see. Strictness is out of fashion, yet it will be essential if Ontario is to avoid the wrath of the bond raters. And that means conflict. If she does her job, she can look forward to teachers' strikes and tax revolts. In fact, she can expect to be reviled by almost everyone.As for Justin's happy dance, not so fast. The biggest election issue these days - especially for the swing voters in Toronto's suburbs - isn't who has the best policies, or which scandal led the news last week, or even who has the most inspiring vision for the future. It's who you can trust not to screw things up too much. Everything else is incidental.\n"
